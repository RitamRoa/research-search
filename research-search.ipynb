        "**Reasoning**:\n",
        "Reading the file line by line and using `on_bad_lines='skip'` did not resolve the `ParserError`. The error \"EOF inside string\" suggests an issue with quoted fields containing newlines or the file being truncated. A more robust approach for such corrupted files is to use a more flexible CSV reader or try to identify the problematic lines and clean them. Given the limitations in interactively debugging the file content, and the persistent `ParserError` even with the Python engine and skipping bad lines, I will try a different strategy using `csv.reader` to read the file line by line and then manually construct the DataFrame. This approach allows for more control over how lines are parsed and can potentially bypass the limitations of `pandas.read_csv` with this specific file.\n",

We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.\",\n          \"This paper generalizes previous optimal upper bounds on the minimum Euclidean distance for phase shift keying (PSK) block codes, that are explicit in three parameters: alphabet size, block length a ...\",\n          \"It is well-known that Sturmian sequences are the non ultimately periodic sequences that are balanced over a 2-letter alphabet. They are also characterized by their complexity: they have exactly $(n+1)$ distinct factors of length $n$. A natural generalization of Sturmian sequences is the set of infinite episturmian sequences. These sequences are not necessarily balanced over a $k$-letter alphabet, nor are they necessarily aperiodic. In this paper, we characterize balanced episturmian sequences, periodic or not, and prove Fraenkel's conjecture for the special case of episturmian sequences. It appears that balanced episturmian sequences are all ultimately periodic and they can be classified in 3 families.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Joaqu\\u00edn J.

We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.\",\n          \"This paper generalizes previous optimal upper bounds on the minimum Euclidean distance for phase shift keying (PSK) block codes, that are explicit in three parameters: alphabet size, block length a ...\",\n          \"It is well-known that Sturmian sequences are the non ultimately periodic sequences that are balanced over a 2-letter alphabet. They are also characterized by their complexity: they have exactly $(n+1)$ distinct factors of length $n$. A natural generalization of Sturmian sequences is the set of infinite episturmian sequences. These sequences are not necessarily balanced over a $k$-letter alphabet, nor are they necessarily aperiodic. In this paper, we characterize balanced episturmian sequences, periodic or not, and prove Fraenkel's conjecture for the special case of episturmian sequences. It appears that balanced episturmian sequences are all ultimately periodic and they can be classified in 3 families.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Joaqu\\u00edn J.

            "Abstract: Widely Linear Processing (WLP), proposed by Brown and Crane in 1969, has recently received a great deal of attention, in particular due to its potential of application in some important problems in array processing. The present work investigates the implementation of the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) algorithm proposed by Frost in the context of widely and strictly linear processing. The results are compared with those obtained via MVDR widely and strictly linear processing.\n",

As for the case of words, Sturmian trees are irrational trees of minimal complexity. We give various examples of Sturmian trees, and we characterize one family of Sturmian trees by means of a structural property of their automata.\n",

Sequential, generally nonlinear estimates of s(t) are established and their performance is studied; error bounds and convergence rates are derived. The signal s(t) need not be band-limited. The convergence rates obtained here are faster than those obtained previously for nonsequential estimates. The degradation in the reconstruction of the signal, due to transmission over a noisy channel, is also investigated, and bounds on the additional error are obtained.\n",

            "Abstract: We present a second order accurate, geometrically flexible and easy to implement method for solving the variable coefficient Poisson equation with interfacial discontinuities or on irregular domains, handling both cases with the same approach. We discretize the equations using an embedded approach on a uniform Cartesian grid employing virtual nodes at interfaces and boundaries. A variational method is used to define numerical stencils near these special virtual nodes and a Lagrange multiplier approach is used to enforce jump conditions and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our combination of these two aspects yields a symmetric positive definite discretization. In the general case, we obtain the standard 5-point stencil away from the interface. For the specific case of interface problems with continuous coefficients, we present a discontinuity removal technique that admits use of the standard 5-point finite difference stencil everywhere in the domain. Numerical experiments indicate second order accuracy in L^~.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to transfer self-timed circuit specifications into sequential quantum Boolean circuits (SQBCs) and composable SQBCs (CQBCs). State graphs (SGs) are used to describe the behaviors of self-timed circuits and then are translated into SQBCs based on Toffoli gates. The concept of IP (intellectual property) reuse is applied to the constructed SQBCs to produce reusable and composable quantum Boolean circuits (CQBCs). Therefore, these reusable CQBCs as basic modular components can be exploited to construct more complicated quantum Boolean circuits. A set of self-timed components is successfully and automatically synthesized into CQBCs by our methodology. These CQBCs can be used as building blocks to compose control-path components of self-timed systems.\n",

            "Abstract: The objective of Prototype Reduction Schemes (PRSs) and Border Identification (BI) algorithms is to reduce the number of training vectors, while simultaneously attempting to guarantee that the classifier built on the reduced design set performs as well, or nearly as well, as the classifier built on the original design set. In this paper, we shall push the limit on the field of PRSs to see if we can obtain a classification accuracy comparable to the optimal, by condensing the information in the data set into a single training point. We, indeed, demonstrate that such PRSs exist and are attainable, and show that the design and implementation of such schemes work with the recently-introduced paradigm of Order Statistics (OS)-based classifiers. These classifiers, referred to as Classification by Moments of Order Statistics (CMOS) is essentially anti-Bayesian in its modus operandus. In this paper, we demonstrate the power and potential of CMOS to yield single-element PRSs which are either \"selective\" or \"creative\", where in each case we resort to a non-parametric or a parametric paradigm respectively. We also report a single-feature single-element creative PRS. All of these solutions have been used to achieve classification for real-life data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, where we have followed an approach that is similar to the Naive-Bayes' (NB) strategy although it is essentially of an anti-Naive-Bayes' paradigm. The amazing facet of this approach is that the training set can be reduced to a single pattern from each of the classes which is, in turn, determined by the CMOS features. It is even more fascinating to see that the scheme can be rendered operational by using the information in a single feature of such a single data point. In each of these cases, the accuracy of the proposed PRS-based approach is very close to the optimal Bayes' bound and is almost comparable to that of the SVM.\n",

            "Abstract: Our dynamic graph-based relational mining approach has been developed to learn structural patterns in biological networks as they change over time. The analysis of dynamic networks is important not only to understand life at the system-level, but also to discover novel patterns in other structural data. Most current graph-based data mining approaches overlook dynamic features of biological networks, because they are focused on only static graphs. Our approach analyzes a sequence of graphs and discovers rules that capture the changes that occur between pairs of graphs in the sequence. These rules represent the graph rewrite rules that the first graph must go through to be isomorphic to the second graph. Then, our approach feeds the graph rewrite rules into a machine learning system that learns general transformation rules describing the types of changes that occur for a class of dynamic biological networks. The discovered graph-rewriting rules show how biological networks change over time, and the transformation rules show the repeated patterns in the structural changes. In this paper, we apply our approach to biological networks to evaluate our approach and to understand how the biosystems change over time. We evaluate our results using coverage and prediction metrics, and compare to biological literature.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper analyzes the worst-case efficiency ratio of false-name-proof combinatorial auction mechanisms. False-name-proofness generalizes strategy-proofness by assuming that a bidder can submit multiple bids under fictitious identifiers. Even the well-known Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism is not false-name-proof. It has previously been shown that there is no false-name-proof mechanism that always achieves a Pareto efficient allocation. Consequently, if false-name bids are possible, we need to sacrifice efficiency to some extent. This leaves the natural question of how much surplus must be sacrificed. To answer this question, this paper focuses on worst-case analysis. Specifically, we consider the fraction of the Pareto efficient surplus that we obtain and try to maximize this fraction in the worst-case, under the constraint of false-name-proofness. As far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to examine the worst-case efficiency of false-name-proof mechanisms.#R##N##R##N#We show that the worst-case efficiency ratio of any false-name-proof mechanism that satisfies some apparently minor assumptions is at most 2/(m + 1) for auctions with m different goods. We also observe that the worst-case efficiency ratio of existing false-name-proof mechanisms is generally 1/m or 0. Finally, we propose a novel mechanism, called the adaptive reserve price mechanism that is false-name-proof when all bidders are single-minded. The worst-case efficiency ratio is 2/(m + 1), i.e., optimal.\n",

            "Abstract: We describe a new extraction tool, EMX (Electro-Magnetic eXtractor), for the analysis of RF, analog and high-speed digital circuits. EMX is a fast full-wave field solver. It incorporates two new techniques which make it significantly faster and more memory-efficient than previous solvers. First, it takes advantage of layout regularity in typical designs. Second, EMX uses a new method for computing the vector-potential component in the mixed potential integral equation. These techniques give a speed-up of more than a factor of ten, together with a corresponding reduction in memory.\n",

            "Abstract: Background#R##N#In the past decade, the identification of gene co-expression has become a routine part of the analysis of high-dimensional microarray data. Gene co-expression, which is mostly detected via the Pearson correlation coefficient, has played an important role in the discovery of molecular pathways and networks. Unfortunately, the presence of systematic noise in high-dimensional microarray datasets corrupts estimates of gene co-expression. Removing systematic noise from microarray data is therefore crucial. Many cleaning approaches for microarray data exist, however these methods are aimed towards improving differential expression analysis and their performances have been primarily tested for this application. To our knowledge, the performances of these approaches have never been systematically compared in the context of gene co-expression estimation.\n",

            "Abstract: Today, public-service delivery mechanisms such as hospitals, police, and fire departments rely on digital generation, storage, and analysis of vital information. To protect critical digital resources, these organizations employ access-control mechanisms, which define rules under which authorized users can access the resources they need to perform organizational tasks. Natural or man-made disasters pose a unique challenge, whereby previously defined constraints can potentially debilitate an organization's ability to act. Here, the authors propose employing contextual parameters - specifically, activity context in the form of emergency warnings - to adapt access-control policies according to a priori configuration.\n",

            "Abstract: The problem of localizing small inhomogeneities from the knowledge of their scattered field is dealt with. In particular, the case of small perfect electric conducting spheres is of concern, with the scattered field data collected under multistatic/multifrequency/single-view or multistatic/single-frequency/multiview far zone configurations. The multiple scattering between the spheres is neglected, and their locations are represented as the supports of the Dirac delta functions. This allows one to cast the problem as the inversion of a linear integral operator, with the delta functions being the unknowns of the problem. The inversion of this linear integral operator is achieved by means of the truncated singular value decomposition. The performance of the linear inversion algorithm against the model error (i.e., for situations where the multiple scattering is not negligible) is investigated by numerical simulations. Furthermore, the effect of noise is also analyzed by corrupting the data by an uncorrelated additive white Gaussian process.\n",

            "Abstract: With evolving modern technology, and widespread deployment of wireless devices, adaptation research is becoming an important issue for overcome various constraints in wireless networks, and maintaining an acceptable level of service. However, most existing research only focuses on wireless device resource utilization, without consideration of proxy server workload execution. In practice, adaptation jobs dynamically converting media formats, consumes a large amount of resources. In this paper, a novel adaptation system is proposed, by distributing workload through nearby cooperative proxies composed of a hierarchical structure. The proposed system has an intelligent engine, which autonomous creates rules. The system performs adaptation work based on rules. A prototype was implemented to evaluate and partly apply this research in a Healthcare scenario. Hence, the effectiveness of the system is confirmed through results, in which the system offers faster adapted content transmission to the user.\n",

In our model, the broadcast is divided into billing periods; during each billing period the entitlement of the users does not change. We achieve full flexibility with only a constant factor data redundancy. Our scheme has very little secure memory requirements and does not require the users' secure keys to be changed once they have been written into the secure memory. There is also no upper limit on the number of subscribers. We extend this scheme to have the cracker identification property: If a collusion of less than t users crack their set-top terminals and produce a new decryption key, the exact set of crackers can be efficiently identified with high probability. This property is similar to but different from the traitor tracing schemes of Chor et al [5].\n",

The properties of handwritten Japanese texts have prevented conventional handwritten European text retrieval methods from being applied to Japanese. To address this problem, the proposed method was devised to segment texts into blocks and search stored texts by using a two-stage flexible matching method. At the first stage, the features used for flexibly matching block series were designed to reduce the amount of the processing which produces features of combined blocks. In the second stage, flexible matching between corresponding blocks was employed to exclude erroneous candidates. Experiments demonstrated 99.5% recall and 20% precision in the case of queries with four characters.\n",

Virtual force field between a robot and an obstacle is formed and regulated to maintain a desired distance. To avoid obstacles on the path of a mobile robot, intelligent hybrid force control is used to regulate force field of an accurate distance between a robot and an obstacle. Since uncertainties from robot dynamics and obstacles degrade the performance of a collision avoidance task, neural network is used to compensate for uncertainties. Simulation studies of avoiding obstacles by maintaining a desired distance on the path of a wheeled mobile robot are conducted to confirm the proposed algorithm.\n",

A subharmonic signal of 1.0475 GHz frequency is injected to the oscillator to lock the oscillation at 2.095 GHz. With the capacitive feedback impedance at the transistor emitter, and inductive load and the resonator at the transistor base, a low phase noise of -92 dBc/Hz at the WKHz offset was obtained. Simulation results show that the phase noise of the oscillation output is only about 0.5 dB higher than that of the injected signal. Such a low noise feature has presented potentials in developing RF synthesizer and front-ends for low-cost wireless and mobile communication transceivers.\n",

            "Abstract: Cluster validity indices are used for estimating the quality of partitions produced by clustering algorithms and for determining the number of clusters in data. Cluster validation is difficult task, because for the same data set more partitions exists regarding the level of details that fit natural groupings of a given data set. Even though several cluster validity indices exist, they are inefficient when clusters widely differ in density or size. We propose a clustering validity index that addresses these issues. It is based on compactness and overlap measures. The overlap measure, which indicates the degree of overlap between fuzzy clusters, is obtained by calculating the overlap rate of all data objects that belong strongly enough to two or more clusters. The compactness measure, which indicates the degree of similarity of data objects in a cluster, is calculated from membership values of data objects that are strongly enough associated to one cluster. We propose ratio and summation type of index using the same compactness and overlap measures. The maximal value of index denotes the optimal fuzzy partition that is expected to have a high compactness and a low degree of overlap among clusters. Testing many well-known previously formulated and proposed indices on well-known data sets showed the superior reliability and effectiveness of the proposed index in comparison to other indices especially when evaluating partitions with clusters that widely differ in size or density.\n",

The suite is intended to ease considerably the process of bringing locked away historical materials to the attention of the general public by covering all the steps from managing a digital collection to creating interactive presentations suited for cultural exhibitions.

            "Abstract: The problem of fault detection and isolation in complex plants can be effectively addressed by a hierarchical strategy involving successive narrowing of the search space of potential faults. A bond graph network is one means of achieving a hierarchical strategy based on the physical domains present in the plant. First, the multivariate statistical method of principal component analysis is used to reduce the data dimension. Second, a discrete wavelet transform is applied to abstract the dynamics at different scales. Thirdly, the Mahalanobis distance is applied to calculate the confidence level. Following a conclusion of the existence of a fault, isolation is achieved by comparing the time scale at which the violation occurred to the time scale associated with a physical domain. In the final step, a Bayesian network is employed to describe the conditional dependence between faulty domains and fault signatures. Two examples are presented to demonstrate these concepts.\n",

Such tampering (also referred to as Hardware Trojan) causes an integrated circuit (IC) to have altered functional behavior, potentially with disastrous consequences in safety-critical applications. Conventional design-time verification and post-manufacturing testing cannot be readily extended to detect hardware Trojans due to their stealthy nature, inordinately large number of possible instances and large variety in structure and operating mode. In this paper, we analyze the threat posed by hardware Trojans and the methods of deterring them. We present a Trojan taxonomy, models of Trojan operations and a review of the state-of-the-art Trojan prevention and detection techniques. Next, we discuss the major challenges associated with this security concern and future research needs to address them.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper we analyze recently introduced questions for masked logic styles in general and for one such logic style called MDPL in particular. The DPA resistance of MDPL suffers significantly from a problem called early propagation, which denotes a data-dependent time of evaluation of logic cells depending on input signal-delay differences. Experiments on a prototype chip show that in case of specific MDPL modules like the analyzed AES coprocessor, early propagation does not unconditionally break the DPA resistance of MDPL. Investigations indicate that this might be due to the regular structure of the particular MDPL circuit, which is assumed to cause only relatively \"small\" signal delay differences. Furthermore, in this article it is shown that the recently proposed, so-called PDF-attack could not be turned into a successful practical attack in our environment. Finally, the recently raised question whether MDPL has special requirements in terms of the generation of random mask bits or not is discussed theoretically.\n",

While it is important to ensure that all nodes get a copy of the broadcast message, minimizing the number of sending nodes is equally important especially in resource-constrained wireless networks. Existing broadcasting protocols based on self-pruning are ineffective in achieving these objectives. Therefore this paper proposes two protocols based on simple timer mechanisms to prioritize broadcasting of messages such that node with most uncovered neighbors rebroadcast first. Additionally a timer suppression mechanism is proposed to further enhance the effectiveness of the broadcasting protocol. Compared with an existing protocol, extensive simulation experiments confirm that the proposed protocols achieve better performance.\n",

            "Abstract: In recent years, diversity techniques have evolved into highly attractive technology for wireless communications in different forms. For instance, the channel fluctuations of the users in a network are exploited as multiuser diversity by scheduling the user with the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). When fading is slow, beamforming at a multiple antenna transmitter is used to induce artificial channel fluctuations to ensure multiuser diversity in the network. Such a beamforming scheme is called opportunistic beamforming since the transmitter uses random beamforming to artificially induce opportunism in the network [1]. Opportunism requires a large number of users in the system in order to reach the performance of the true beamforming that uses perfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper we investigate the benefit of having partial CSI at an opportunistic transmitter. In the investigation, we focus on the maximum normalized SNR scheduling where user's feedback consists of SNR relative to its channel gain. We show that opportunism can be beneficially used to increase the average throughput of the system. Simulations support the analytical average throughput results obtained as the amount of CSI and the number of users vary.\n",

Taylor (1984) are computable, and an algorithm for computing them by reducing fine motion planing to an algebraic decision problem is presented. Fine-motion planning involves planning a successful motion of a robot at the fine scale of assembly operations, where control and sensor uncertainty are significant. It is shown that, as long as the envelope of trajectories generated by the control system can be described algebraically, there is an effective procedure for deciding if a successful n-step plan exists. The proposed method makes use of recognizable sets as subgoals for multistep planning. These sets are finitely parameterizable, and it is shown that they are the only sets that need be considered as subgoals. Unfortunately, if the full generality of the LMT framework is used, finding a fine-motion plan can take time double exponential in the number of plant steps. >\n",

It presents a comprehensive review of research efforts underway dealing with pedestrian safety and collision avoidance. The importance of pedestrian protection is emphasized in a global context, discussing the research programs and efforts in various countries. Pedestrian safety measures, including infrastructure enhancements and passive safety features in vehicles, are described, followed by a systematic description of active safety systems based on pedestrian detection using sensors in vehicle and infrastructure. The pedestrian detection approaches are classified according to various criteria such as the type and configuration of sensors, as well as the video cues and classifiers used in detection algorithms. It is noted that collision avoidance not only requires detection of pedestrians but also requires collision prediction using pedestrian dynamics and behavior analysis. Hence, this paper includes research dealing with probabilistic modeling of pedestrian behavior for predicting collisions between pedestrians and vehicles.\n",

The process of work and the computing resources are defined, registered, consumed and orchestrated services. We address several key issues in this analysis environment and study a typical case based on a prototype system. The new paradigm leverages available engineering resources embodied as loosely-coupled services. Service oriented computing has great potential in engineering application.\n",

            "Abstract: A fundamental result of statistical learning theory states that a concept class is PAC learnable if and only if it is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli class if and only if the VC dimension of the class is finite. However, the theorem is only valid under special assumptions of measurability of the class, in which case the PAC learnability even becomes consistent. Otherwise, there is a classical example, constructed under the Continuum Hypothesis by Dudley and Durst and further adapted by Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler, and Warmuth, of a concept class of VC dimension one which is neither uniform Glivenko-Cantelli nor consistently PAC learnable. We show that, rather surprisingly, under an additional set-theoretic hypothesis which is much milder than the Continuum Hypothesis (Martin's Axiom), PAC learnability is equivalent to finite VC dimension for every concept class.\n",

Apart from giving good compression rates and being fast, BH can provide random access to spatial locations in the image. We hypothesize that BH works well because it accommodates the rapidly changing image brightness that often occurs in hyperspectral images. We also propose an intra-band compressor called LM which is worse than BH, but whose performance helps explain BH's performance.\n",

This article focuses on the importance of public library Internet access in times of emergencies and for a range of electronic government (e–government) services at the individual and community–wide levels. Public access computing and Internet access in public libraries function as a first choice, first refuge, and last resort in a range of emergency and e–government circumstances, allowing individuals to engage successfully in essential e–government services such as registering for Medicare or other benefits and filing tax information. With this key centrality as agents of government services, public libraries increasingly play significant roles in times of emergencies, like the aftermath of a hurricane, in which communities rely on the public library Internet access to request aid, try to find missing family and friends, file Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and insurance claims, and begin rebuilding their lives.

            "Abstract: To deal with complex optimization problems plagued with computationally expensive fitness functions, the use of surrogates to replace the original functions within the evolutionary framework is becoming a common practice. However, the appropriate datacentric approximation methodology to use for the construction of surrogate model would depend largely on the nature of the problem of interest, which varies from fitness landscape and state of the evolutionary search, to the characteristics of search algorithm used. This has given rise to the plethora of surrogate-assisted evolutionary frameworks proposed in the literature with ad hoc approximation/surrogate modeling methodologies considered. Since prior knowledge on the suitability of the data centric approximation methodology to use in surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization is typically unavailable beforehand, this paper presents a novel evolutionary framework with the evolvability learning of surrogates EvoLS operating on multiple diverse approximation methodologies in the search. Further, in contrast to the common use of fitness prediction error as a criterion for the selection of surrogates, the concept of evolvability to indicate the productivity or suitability of an approximation methodology that brings about fitness improvement in the evolutionary search is introduced as the basis for adaptation. The backbone of the proposed EvoLS is a statistical learning scheme to determine the evolvability of each approximation methodology while the search progresses online. For each individual solution, the most productive approximation methodology is inferred, that is, the method with highest evolvability measure. Fitness improving surrogates are subsequently constructed for use within a trust-region enabled local search strategy, leading to the self-configuration of a surrogate-assisted memetic algorithm for solving computationally expensive problems. A numerical study of EvoLS on commonly used benchmark problems and a real-world computationally expensive aerodynamic car rear design problem highlights the efficacy of the proposed EvoLS in attaining reliable, high quality, and efficient performance under a limited computational budget.\n",

Experimental results show face recognition using such a codebook is more efficient than the codebook consisted of 4×4 codevector used in conventional algorithm. The highest average recognition rate of 98.6% is obtained for 40 persons’ 400 images of publicly available face database of AT&T Laboratories Cambridge containing variations in lighting, posing, and expressions.

            "Abstract: Mixing the actor model with other concurrency models in a single program can break the actor abstraction. This increases the chance of creating deadlocks and data races--two mistakes that are hard to make with actors. Furthermore, it prevents the use of many advanced testing, modeling, and verification tools for actors, as these require pure actor programs. This study is the first to point out the phenomenon of mixing concurrency models by Scala developers and to systematically identify the factors leading to it. We studied 15 large, mature, and actively maintained actor programs written in Scala and found that 80% of them mix the actor model with another concurrency model. Consequently, a large part of real-world actor programs does not use actors to their fullest advantage. Inspection of the programs and discussion with the developers reveal two reasons for mixing that can be influenced by researchers and library-builders: weaknesses in the actor library implementations, and shortcomings of the actor model itself.\n",

            "Abstract: One way of making speech recognisers more robust to noise is model compensation. Rather than enhancing the incoming observations, model compensation techniques modify a recogniser's state-conditional distributions so they model the speech in the target environment. Because the interaction between speech and noise is non-linear, even for Gaussian speech and noise the corrupted speech distribution has no closed form. Thus, model compensation methods approximate it with a parametric distribution, such as a Gaussian or a mixture of Gaussians. The impact of this approximation has never been quantified. This paper therefore introduces a non-parametric method to compute the likelihood of a corrupted speech observation. It uses sampling and, given speech and noise distributions and a mismatch function, is exact in the limit. It therefore gives a theoretical bound for model compensation. Though computing the likelihood is computationally expensive, the novel method enables a performance comparison based on the criterion that model compensation methods aim to minimise: the KL divergence to the ideal compensation.

This paper examines the performance of various compensation methods, such as vector Taylor series (VTS) and data-driven parallel model combination (DPMC). It shows that more accurate modelling than Gaussian-for-Gaussian compensation improves the performance of speech recognition.\n",

            "Abstract: We describe concepts to support the analysis of cell phone menu hierarchies, based on cognitive models of users and easy-to-use optimization techniques. We present an empirical study of user performance on five simple tasks of menu traversal on an example cell phone. Two of the models applied to these tasks, based on GOMS and ACT-R, give good predictions of behavior. We use the empirically supported models to create an effective evaluation and improvement process for menu hierarchies. Our work makes three main contributions: a novel and timely study of a new, very common HCI task; new versions of existing models for accurately predicting performance; and a search procedure to generate menu hierarchies that reduce traversal time, in simulation studies, by about a third.\n",

            "Abstract: Spreadsheets are established data collection and analysis tools in business, technical computing and academic research. Excel, for example, offers an attractive user interface, provides an easy to use data entry model, and offers substantial interactivity for what-if analysis. However, spreadsheets and other common client applications do not offer scalable computation for large scale data analytics and exploration. Increasingly researchers in domains ranging from the social sciences to environmental sciences are faced with a deluge of data, often sitting in spreadsheets such as Excel or other client applications, and they lack a convenient way to explore the data, to find related data sets, or to invoke scalable analytical models over the data. To address these limitations, we have developed a cloud data analytics service based on Daytona, which is an iterative MapReduce runtime optimized for data analytics. In our model, Excel and other existing client applications provide the data entry and user interaction surfaces, Daytona provides a scalable runtime on the cloud for data analytics, and our service seamlessly bridges the gap between the client and cloud. Any analyst can use our data analytics service to discover and import data from the cloud, invoke cloud scale data analytics algorithms to extract information from large datasets, invoke data visualization, and then store the data back to the cloud all through a spreadsheet or other client application they are already familiar with.\n",

In both cases, they use the same fuzzy measure. The results presented here permit one to envision new indexes defined in terms of fuzzy integrals using other types of fuzzy measures. A few considerations in this respect are also included in this paper. Indexes for taking into account recent research and the publisher credibility are outlined.\n",

However, the performance loss is less than 25% for various benchmark applications. As the number of cores increases for the future multi-core systems, the effects of area and power saving by the proposed schemes increase, but the performance loss is reduced.\n",

The researches are mainly concentrated on worm propagation and detection more than the fundamental characteristics of worms. It is very important to know worms' characteristics because the characteristics provide basic resource for worm prevention. Unfortunately, this kind of research cases are very few until now. Moreover the existing researches only focus on understanding the function structure of the worm propagation or the taxonomy of the worm according to a sequence of worm attacks. Thus, in this paper, we try to confirm the formalized pattern of the worm action from the existing researches and analyze the report of the anti-virus companies. Finally, we define the formalized actions based on temporal behaviors and worm packet flows, and we apply our proposed method for the new worm classification.\n",

            "Abstract: Social networking sites, such as MySpace, Facebook and Flickr, are gaining more and more popularity among Internet users. As users are enjoying this new style of networking, privacy concerns are also attracting increasing public attention due to reports about privacy breaches on social networking sites. We propose FaceCloak, an architecture that protects user privacy on a social networking site by shielding a user's personal information from the site and from other users that were not explicitly authorized by the user. At the same time, FaceCloak seamlessly maintains usability of the site's services. FaceCloak achieves these goals by providing fake information to the social networking site and by storing sensitive information in encrypted form on a separate server. We implemented our solution as a Firefox browser extension for the Facebook platform. Our experiments show that our solution successfully conceals a user's personal information, while allowing the user and her friends to explore Facebook pages and services as usual.\n",

            "Abstract: This work deals with the power allocation problem in a multipoint-to-multipoint network, which is heterogenous in the sense that each transmit and receiver pair can arbitrarily choose whether to selfishly maximize its own rate or energy efficiency. This is achieved by modeling the transmit and rec eiver pairs as rational players that engage in a non-cooperative game in which the utility function changes according to each player's nature. The underlying game is reformulated as a quasi variational inequality (QVI) problem using convex fractional program theory. The equivalence between the QVI and the non- cooperative game provides us with all the mathematical tools to study the uniqueness of its Nash equilibrium (NE) points and to derive novel algorithms that allow the network to converge to these points in an iterative manner both with and without the need for a centralized processing. Numerical results are used to validate the proposed solutions in different operating conditions.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper analyses the following seven sub-fields of Sustainable Energy Research with respect to the influence of proceedings papers on citation patterns across citing and cited document types, overall sub-field and document type impacts and citedness: the Wind Power, Renewable Energy, Solar and Wave Energy, Geo-thermal, Bio-fuel and Bio-mass energy sub-fields. The analyses cover peer reviewed research and review articles as well as two kinds of proceeding papers from conferences published 2005---2009 in (a) book series or volumes and (b) special journal issues excluding meeting abstracts cited 2005---2011 through Web of Science. Central findings are: The distribution across document types of cited versus citing documents is highly asymmetric. Predominantly proceedings papers from both proceeding volumes as well as published in journals cite research articles (60---76 %). Largely, journal-based proceedings papers are cited rather than papers published in book series or volumes and have field impacts corresponding to research articles. With decreasing proceedings paper dominance in research fields the ratio of proceeding paper volumes over journal-based proceedings papers decreases significantly and the percentage of proceedings papers in journals citing journal-based proceedings papers over all publications citing journal-based proceedings papers decreases significantly (from 26.3 % in Wind Power to 4 % in Bio Fuel). Further, the segment of all kinds of proceedings papers (the combined proceedings paper types) citing all proceedings papers over all publications citing all kinds of proceedings papers decreases significantly (from 36.1 % in Wind Power to 11.3 % in Bio Fuel). Simultaneously the field citedness increases across the seven research fields. The distribution of citations from review articles shows that novel knowledge essentially derives directly from research articles (53---72 %)--to a much less extent from proceedings publications published in journals (9---13 %).\n",

            "Abstract: Human recognition from arbitrary views is an important task for many applications, such as visual surveillance, covert security and access control. It has been found to be very difficult in reality, especially when a person is walking at a distance in read-world outdoor conditions. For optimal performance, the system should use as much information as possible from the observations. In this paper, we propose an innovative system, which combines cues of face profile and gait silhouette from the single camera video sequences. For optimal face profile recognition, we first reconstruct a high-resolution face profile image from several adjacent low-resolution video frames. Then we use a curvature-based matching method for recognition. For gait, we use Gait Energy Image (GEI) to characterize human walking properties. Recognition is carried out based on the direct GEI matching. Several schemes are considered for fusion of face profile and gait. A number of dynamic video sequences are tested to evaluate the performance of our system. Experiment results are compared and discussed.\n",

The development of voice search for these languages led to a significant simplification of the original process to build a system for any new language which in in parts became our default process for internationalization of voice search.\n",

Many BRL algorithms have already been proposed, but the benchmarks used to compare them are only relevant for specific cases. The paper addresses this problem, and provides a new BRL comparison methodology along with the corresponding open source library. In this methodology, a comparison criterion that measures the performance of algorithms on large sets of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) drawn from some probability distributions is defined. In order to enable the comparison of non-anytime algorithms, our methodology also includes a detailed analysis of the computation time requirement of each algorithm. Our library is released with all source code and documentation: it includes three test problems, each of which has two different prior distributions, and seven state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Finally, our library is illustrated by comparing all the available algorithms and the results are discussed.\n",

            "Abstract: In multi-antenna communication systems, channel information is often not known at the receiver. To fully exploit bandwidth resources of the system and ensure practical feasibility of the receiver, channel parameters are often estimated blindly and then employed in the design of signal detection algorithms. Instead of separating channel estimation from signal detection, in this paper we focus on the joint channel estimation and signal detection problem in a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system. It is well known that finding solution to this optimization requires solving an integer maximization of a quadratic form and is, in general, an NP hard problem. To solve it, we propose an approximate algorithm based on the semi-definite program (SDP) relaxation. We derive a bound on the pairwise probability of error (PEP) of the proposed algorithm and show that, the algorithm achieves the same diversity as the exact maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder. The computed PEP implies that, over a wide range of system parameters, the proposed algorithm requires moderate increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in order to achieve performance comparable to that of the ML decoder but with often significantly lower complexity.\n",

Cache-based route repair schemes are popular choices since they can quickly resume communications using cached backup paths after a route break. In this paper, through thorough theoretical modeling of the cache-based route repair process, we derive the optimal cache-based route repair policy. This optimal policy considers both the overhead of the route repair schemes and the promptness of the repair action. The correctness and advantages of our optimal policy are validated by extensive simulations.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method to adapt the temporal radio maps for indoor location estimation by offsetting the variational environmental factors using data mining techniques and reference points. Environmental variations, which cause the signals to change from time to time even at the same location, present a challenging task for indoor location estimation in the IEEE 802.11b infrastructure. In such a dynamic environment, the radio maps obtained in one time period may not be applicable in other time periods. To solve this problem, we apply a regression analysis to learn the temporal predictive relationship between the signal-strength values received by sparsely located reference points and that received by the mobile device. This temporal prediction model can then be used for online localization based on the newly observed signal-strength values at the client side and the reference points. We show that this technique can effectively accommodate the variations of signal-strength values over different time periods without the need to rebuild the radio maps repeatedly. We also show that the location of mobile device can be accurately determined using this technique with lower density in the distribution of the reference points\n",

We propose the Yet Another GCI/GOI Algorithm (YAGA) to detect GCIs from speech signals by employing multiscale analysis, the group delay function, and  N -best dynamic programming. A novel GOI detector based upon the consistency of the candidates' closed quotients relative to the estimated GCIs is also presented. Particular attention is paid to the precise definition of the glottal closed phase, which we define as the analysis interval that produces minimum deviation from an all-pole model of the speech signal with closed-phase linear prediction (LP). A reference algorithm analyzing both electroglottograph (EGG) and speech signals is described for evaluation of the proposed speech-based algorithm. In addition to the development of a GCI/GOI detector, an important outcome of this work is in demonstrating that GOIs derived from the EGG signal are not necessarily well-suited to closed-phase LP analysis. Evaluation of YAGA against the APLAWD and SAM databases show that GCI identification rates of up to 99.3% can be achieved with an accuracy of 0.3 ms and GOI detection can be achieved equally reliably with an accuracy of 0.5 ms.\n",

            "Abstract: Sensor photoresponse nonuniformity has been proposed as a unique identifier (fingerprint) for various forensic tasks, including digital-camera ballistics in which an image is matched to the specific camera that took it. The problem investigated here concerns the situation when an adversary estimates the sensor fingerprint from a set of images and superimposes it onto an image from a different camera to frame an innocent victim. This paper proposes a reliable method for detecting such fake fingerprints under rather mild and general assumptions about the adversary's activity and the means available to the victim. The proposed method is subjected to experiments to evaluate its reliability as well as its limitations. The conclusion that can be made from this study is that planting a sensor fingerprint in an image without leaving a trace is significantly more difficult than previously thought.\n",

Even though the calibration of a catadioptric system includes the estimation of various parameters, in this paper we focus on the localization of the mirror. Since some previously proposed methods assume a single view point system, they have strong restrictions on the position and shape of the mirror. We propose a method that uses parallel lights to simplify the geometry of projection for estimating the position of the mirror, thereby not restricting the position or shape of the mirror. Further, we omit the translation process between the camera and calibration objects from the parameters to be estimated by observing some parallel lights from a different direction. We obtain the constraints on the projection and compute the error between the model of the mirror and the measurements. The position of the mirror is estimated by minimizing the error. We also test our method by simulation and real experiments, and finally we evaluate the accuracy of our method.\n",

More recently, policy statements and guidance from the UK government have underlined the importance of ICT for adults with learning disabilities specifically, as well as for the population in general, through the potential it offers for social inclusion. The aim of the present study was to provide a picture of how ICT is currently being used within one organisation providing specialist services for adults with learning disabilities and more specifically to provide a picture of its use in promoting community participation. Nine day and 14 residential services were visited as part of a qualitative study to answer three main questions: What kinds of computer programs are being used? What are they being used for? Does this differ between day and residential services? Computers and digital cameras were used for a wide range of activities and ‘mainstream’ programs were used more widely than those developed for specific user groups. In day services, ICT was often embedded in wider projects and activities, whilst use in houses was based around leisure interests. In both contexts, ICT was being used to facilitate communication, although this was more linked to within-service activities, rather than those external to service provision.\n",

As a result, Web users may not have a good understanding of the changes that occur. In this paper we show that making Web content change explicitly visible allows people to interact with the Web in new ways. We present a longitudinal study in which 30 people used a Web browser plug-in that caches visited pages and highlights text changes to those pages when revisited. We used a survey to capture their understanding of Web page change and their own revisitation patterns at the beginning of use and after one month. For a majority of the participants, we also logged their Web page visits and associated content change. Exposing change is more valuable to our participants than initially expected, making them aware of how dynamic content they visit is and changing their interactions with it.\n",

            "Abstract: We consider the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in half duplex relay channels. In recent work by Azarian et al. [2], it was shown that Dynamic Decode and Forward (DDF) strictly dominates all the other schemes in the high SNR (HSNR) regime, with the inherent assumption that all the links have the same average SNR p. In this work, we introduce geometry into the problem by letting the SNR of different links scale differently with p. We exhaustively identify the tradeoff for DDF and Non- Orthogonal Amplify and Forward (NAF) when the SNRs are different. We show that, even when geometry is included, the dominance behavior of DDF still holds. In some regions, NAF can at most do as well as DDF. We also show that when the multiplexing gain exceeds the exponential order of the SNR of either source to relay or relay to destination channels, the tradeoff curve of DDF reduces to that of direct transmission.\n",

Firstly, the local principal edge information in the damaged area is detected in the spatial domain. Then the proposed orthogonal edge directed filters (OEDFs) are applied to remove the ring or ripple artifact errors due to the loss of some wavelet transform (WT) bitplane data. Two kinds of constraints in WT domain are used for rectifying the recovered WT coefficients obtained from OEDFs, namely the WT known-value constraint and the empirical statistical constraint of the WT coefficients. Finally, this filtering-and-rectifying procedure is iterated until convergent. Simulation results have shown that both objective and subjective image quality have been improved by our proposed algorithm.\n",

Especially, there does not exist a micro-benchmark to measure how the performance of individual primitive operations varies with the type of misbehavior. In the paper, we present VITS - a micro-benchmark to evaluate the performance isolation of virtualization system. VITS Test Suite can test both software and hardware performance isolation. It is mainly consisted of six interference programs, which respectively test the performance isolation of cache, memory bandwidth, memory space, CPU, network and disk. VITS Test Suite provides results for user to analyze the performance isolation problem of the virtualization system along with the underlying hardware. Besides, we test Xen using VITS test suit. The experimental results show that, the cache, memory and disk performance isolation still have some big weak points to improve, in other words, the current virtualization system Xen is still unfair in fine-grained resource share.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper analyzes the way an auctioneer can arrange a series of sequential English auctions to maximize the total revenue. We consider the case in which heterogeneous common value objects are sold in these auctions, and each bidder has a budget constraint that allows it to buy at most one object. In such a setting, bidders need to determine how much to bid in each auction. Furthermore, biddersý strategies change if the agenda (i.e., the order in which the objects are auctioned) changes. Consequently, the total revenue from the series of auctions can be changed by changing the agenda. Given this, the auctioneer clearly wants to determine the optimal agenda (i.e., the one that maximizes the total revenue). To this end, we first determine the equilibrium bidding strategies for players that know their own budget constraint, but have incomplete information about the othersý constraints. On the basis of these strategies, we determine the total revenue for different agendas.\n",

Network throughput and protection to link failure under uniform traffic distribution for all nodes are investigated to evaluate the sensitivity of OPS/OBSN performance. Our data are based on analytic results and computer simulations that include a comparison between various mesh and ring topologies. We also consider detailed traffic distributions over the network links and the impact caused by failure of more or less loaded links, thus providing a method to select links that require protection, which can be very useful in network planning.\n",

            "Abstract: Future advanced driver assistance systems will contain multiple sensors that are used for several applications, such as highly automated driving on freeways. The problem is that the sensors are usually asynchronous and their data possibly out-of-sequence, making fusion of the sensor data non-trivial. This paper presents a novel approach to track-to-track fusion for automotive applications with asynchronous and out-of-sequence sensors using information matrix fusion. This approach solves the problem of correlation between sensor data due to the common process noise and common track history, which eliminates the need to replace the global track estimate with the fused local estimate at each fusion cycle. The information matrix fusion approach is evaluated in simulation and its performance demonstrated using real sensor data on a test vehicle designed for highly automated driving on freeways.\n",

            "Abstract: Current-generation automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems model spoken discourse as a quasi-linear sequence of words and phones. Because it is unusual for every phone within a word to be pronounced in a standard (\"canonical\") way, ASR systems often depend on a multi-pronunciation lexicon to match an acoustic sequence with a lexical unit. Since there are, in practice, many different ways for a word to be pronounced, this standard approach adds a layer of complexity and ambiguity to the decoding process which, if simplified, could potentially improve recognition performance. Systematic analysis of pronunciation variation in a corpus of spontaneous English discourse (Switchboard) demonstrates that the variation observed is more systematic at the level of the syllable than at the phonetic-segment level. Thus, syllabic onsets are realized in canonical form far more frequently than either coda or nuclear constituents. Prosodic prominence and lexical stress also appear to play an important role in pronunciation variation. The governing mechanism is likely to involve the informational valence associated with syllabic and lexical elements, and for this reason pronunciation variation offers a potential window onto the mechanisms responsible for the production and understanding of spoken language.\n",

By exploring the external service servers on the network, the ability of a humanoid is extendable beyond its resource constrains. This system is named network-based humanoid. In this paper, the network-based humanoid architecture (NBHA) is proposed to provide a core framework to develop this network-based humanoid system. It creates a system where humans, robots, and external service servers can interact without complicated configuration. Using this architecture, behaviors can be created, added and removed dynamically. A number of experiments have been conducted successfully by using JadeLeap middleware, FIPA standard and JESS rule engine on our humanoid. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture provides the extendable behavior control system in the network environment, decreases the development time for adding new services and it decreases the time for network connection of robots and user devices\n",

            "Abstract: For high-dimensional regression, the number of predictors may greatly exceed the sample size but only a small fraction of them are related to the response. Therefore, variable selection is inevitable, where consistent model selection is the primary concern. However, conventional consistent model selection criteria like Bayesian information criterion (BIC) may be inadequate due to their nonadaptivity to the model space and infeasibility of exhaustive search. To address these two issues, we establish a probability lower bound of selecting the smallest true model by an information criterion, based on which we propose a model selection criterion, what we call RICc, which adapts to the model space. Furthermore, we develop a computationally feasible method combining the computational power of least angle regression (LAR) with that of RICc. Both theoretical and simulation studies show that this method identifies the smallest true model with probability converging to one if the smallest true model is selected by LAR. The proposed method is applied to real data from the power market and outperforms the backward variable selection in terms of price forecasting accuracy. Copyright © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

            "Abstract: In order to respond appropriately to environmental stimuli, organisms must integrate over time spatiotemporal signals that reflect object motion and self-movement. One possible mechanism to achieve this spatiotemporal transformation is to delay or lag neural responses. This paper reviews our recent modeling work testing the sufficiency of delayed responses in the nervous system in two different behavioral tasks: (1) Categorizing spatiotemporal tactile cues with thalamic ''lag'' cells and downstream coincidence detectors, and (2) Predictive motor control was achieved by the cerebellum through a delayed eligibility trace rule at cerebellar synapses. Since the timing of these neural signals must closely match real-world dynamics, we tested these ideas using the brain based device (BBD) approach in which a simulated nervous system is embodied in a robotic device. In both tasks, biologically inspired neural simulations with delayed neural responses were critical for successful behavior by the device.\n",

            "Abstract: An architecture and its four load balancing algorithms for a highly OR-parallel inference machine are proposed, and its performance is evaluated in a trace-driven simulation study. This inference machine consists of a large number of processing elements (PEs) with serial I/O links directly connected to each other in a simply modified mesh network. Each PE is a high-speed sequential Prolog processor with its own local memory. The activity of all PEs is locally controlled by four new load balancing algorithms based on purely local communication. Communication is allowed only between directly connected PEs. These load balancing algorithms reduce communication overhead in a load balancing and make it possible to accomplish highly OR-parallel execution. A software simulator using a trace-driven simulation technique based on an inference tree has been developed, and some typical OR-parallel benchmarks such as the n-queens problem have been simulated on it. The average communication per load balancing is reduced by a factor ranging from 1/30 to 1/100 by the interaction of these load balancing algorithms as compared with a conventional copying method. The inference machine (1024 PEs; 32/spl times/32 array) attains 300-600 times parallel speedup, assuming 1 MLIPS (mega logical inferences per second) PE and a 20 MBPS (mega bits per second) each serial I/O link, which could be easily integrated on a single chip using current VLSI technology. This highly OR-parallel inference machine promises to be an important step towards the realization of a high-performance artificial intelligence system. >\n",

            "Abstract: Transform coding using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) has been widely used in image and video coding standards, but at low bit rates, the coded images suffer from severe visual distortions which prevent further bit reduction. Postprocessing can reduce these distortions and alleviate the conflict between bit rate reduction and quality preservation. Viewing postprocessing as an inverse problem, we solve it via a Bayesian approach. The distortion caused by coding is modeled as additive, spatially correlated Gaussian noise, while the original image is modeled as a high order Markov random field (MRF) based on the recently proposed fields of experts (FoE) framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method, in most cases, achieves higher PSNR gain than other methods and the processed images possess good visual quality.\n",

            "Abstract: An improved approach to the design of hierarchical controls proposed here addresses a range of problems insurmountable for traditional quasi-linear approaches. The large dimensionality of power systems and other complex electromechanical systems, measured in terms of the number of state variables, exponentially complicates the process of designing system controls, creating the so-called “curse of dimensionality” [1]. The approach of hierarchical control, introduced in [2] and further developed in [3] and [4], introduces an organization of the controls that is structured similarly to controls in biological systems - that is arranged in superimposed or hierarchical levels [5]. This hierarchical approach dramatically simplifies the control design process by decomposing the original problem - design of a single high-order controller - into a problem of design of many low-order controllers. The global control objective is then achieved by coordinating all of the local goals. Often, linearized models of the system are used when designing these low order controllers, but this introduces a trap that can lead to severe system failures because any disturbance that involves change of the system parameters and/or change of the operating point can move the system out of the range of linearity. Such a disturbance can produce spectacular failures such as that observed during the electrical blackout of 2003 in New York City [4].\n",

The cost of placing an order at a location depends on the set of items ordered there. Demand for the items is constant, and there is a linear holding cost for each item at each location. Only nested policies are considered. A known heuristic is guaranteed to find a policy that is within 2% of optimal. However, if there are M items and L locations the running time of the heuristic is OM4L4. We improve the running time to OMLD logML where D is at most the maximum of the depth of the location and family arborescences.\n",

Accurate force guidance is achieved through the use of an end-effector mounted jig in conjunction with the proper design of the compliance of the manipulator and the material removal tool. The compliance of the manipulator is designed so that: 1) an initial unique relative position/orientation of the jig with respect to the workpart edge is attained despite manipulator positioning error; and 2) the unique relative position initially established is maintained while moving along the workpart edge. Also, the stiffness of the material removal tool is regulated to ensure that forces associated with material removal do not degrade the accuracy of jig-assisted force guided manipulator positioning. This work has application in material removal processes in which accurate positioning with respect to an edge is important, e.g., robotic deburring and aircraft panel drilling. Conditions on the manipulator compliance also have application in robotic assembly. >\n",

A famous model to capture the essential biological features of a conserved gene cluster is called the gene-team model. The problem of finding the gene teams of two general sequences is the focus of this paper. For this problem, He and Goldwasser had an efficient algorithm that requires O(mn) time using O(m + n) working space, where m and n are, respectively, the numbers of genes in the two given sequences. In this paper, a new efficient algorithm is presented. Assume m \\le n. Let C = \\sum _{\\alpha \\in \\Sigma } o_{1}(\\alpha )o_{2}(\\alpha ), where \\Sigma is the set of distinct genes, and o_{1}(\\alpha ) and o_{2}(\\alpha ) are, respectively, the numbers of copies of α in the two given sequences. Our new algorithm requires O({\\rm min}\\{C{\\rm lg}n, mn\\}) time using O(m + n) working space. As compared with He and Goldwasser's algorithm, our new algorithm is more practical, as C is likely to be much smaller than mn in practice. In addition, our new algorithm is output sensitive. Its running time is O({\\rm lg}n) times the size of the output. Moreover, our new algorithm can be efficiently extended to find the gene teams of k general sequences in O(kClg(n_{1}n_{2} \\ldots n_{k})) time, where n_i is the number of genes in the ith input sequence.\n",

Proceeding in that way continuous Petri nets have been defined. For infinite servers semantics, switching linear systems appear through the presence of minimum operators due to synchronizations. The analysis of the ODEs defining the semantics of those hybrid models suffers from two problems: the existence of the minimum operators and stiffness. In discrete models, an approximated way to deal with stiffness was to classify the transitions into immediate and timed (thus markings are divided into vanishing and tangible). Avoiding synchronizations (hence minimum operators) and removing immediate transitions at net level becomes a crucial issue for continuous Petri nets because timed continuous net models and ODEs are isomorphous.

In this paper we prove two hardness results for the problem of finding a low degree polynomial threshold function (PTF) which has the maximum possible agreement with a given set of labeled examples in R  n   x {−1, 1}. We prove that for any constants  d  ≥ 1, e > 0,   • Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, no polynomial-time algorithm can find a degree- d  PTF that is consistent with a (1/2 + e) fraction of a given set of labeled examples in R  n   x {−1, 1}, even if there exists a degree- d  PTF that is consistent with a 1 − e fraction of the examples.   • It is NP-hard to find a degree-2 PTF that is consistent with a (1/2 + e) fraction of a given set of labeled examples in R  n   x {−1, 1}, even if there exists a half-space (degree-1 PTF) that is consistent with a 1 − e fraction of the examples.   These results immediately imply the following hardness of learning results: (i) Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, there is no better-than-trivial proper learning algorithm that agnostically learns degree- d  PTFs under arbitrary distributions; (ii) There is no better-than-trivial learning algorithm that outputs degree-2 PTFs and agnostically learns halfspaces (i.e. degree-1 PTFs) under arbitrary distributions.\n",

            "Abstract: Virtualized datacenters and clouds are being increasingly considered for traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads that have typically targeted Grids and conventional HPC platforms. However, maximizing energy efficiency and utilization of datacenter resources, and minimizing undesired thermal behavior while ensuring application performance and other Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for HPC applications requires careful consideration of important and extremely challenging tradeoffs. Virtual Machine (VM) migration is one of the most common techniques used to alleviate thermal anomalies (i.e., hotspots) in cloud datacenter servers as it reduces load and, hence, the server utilization. In this article, the benefits of using other techniques such as voltage scaling and pinning (traditionally used for reducing energy consumption) for thermal management over VM migrations are studied in detail. As no single technique is the most efficient to meet temperature/performance optimization goals in all situations, an autonomic approach that performs energy-efficient thermal management while ensuring the QoS delivered to the users is proposed. To address the problem of VM allocation that arises during VM migrations, an innovative application-centric energy-aware strategy for Virtual Machine (VM) allocation is proposed. The proposed strategy ensures high resource utilization and energy efficiency through VM consolidation while satisfying application QoS by exploiting knowledge obtained through application profiling along multiple dimensions (CPU, memory, and network bandwidth utilization). To support our arguments, we present the results obtained from an experimental evaluation on real hardware using HPC workloads under different scenarios.\n",

However, as the main force of the ICT field, the mobile networks, are currently focusing on the capacity, variety and stability of the communication services, without paying too much severe concerns on the energy efficiency. The escalating energy costs and environmental concerns have already created an urgent need for more energy-efficient \"green\" wireless communications. In this paper, we survey and discuss various remarkable techniques toward green mobile networks to date, mainly targeting mobile cellular networks. We also summarize the current research projects related to green mobile networks, along with the taxonomy of energy-efficiency metrics. We finally discuss and elaborate future research opportunities and design challenges for green mobile networks.\n",

            "Abstract: The AMI Meeting Corpus is a multi-modal data set consisting of 100 hours of meeting recordings. It is being created in the context of a project that is developing meeting browsing technology and will eventually be released publicly. Some of the meetings it contains are naturally occurring, and some are elicited, particularly using a scenario in which the participants play different roles in a design team, taking a design project from kick-off to completion over the course of a day. The corpus is being recorded using a wide range of devices including close-talking and far-field microphones, individual and room-view video cameras, projection, a whiteboard, and individual pens, all of which produce output signals that are synchronized with each other. It is also being hand-annotated for many different phenomena, including orthographic transcription, discourse properties such as named entities and dialogue acts, summaries, emotions, and some head and hand gestures. We describe the data set, including the rationale behind using elicited material, and explain how the material is being recorded, transcribed and annotated.\n",

            "Abstract: This work presents a method to model a spherical mesh by modifying its heightmap in an augmented reality environment. Our contribution is the use of the hierarchical structure of semiregular A4-8 meshes to represent a dynamic deformable mesh suitable for modeling. It defines only a fraction of the overall terrain that is subjected to local deformations. The modeling of spherical terrains is achieved with proper subdivision constraints at the singularities of the parametric space. An error metric dependent on the observer and on the geometry of the topography was used to provide fast visualization and editing. The results demonstrate that the use of the A4-8 mesh combined with the tangible augmented reality system is flexible to shape spherical terrains and can be easily modified to deal with other topologies, such as the torus and the cylinder.\n",

This paper presents two approaches to WLAN design that allows the designer to describe where the WLAN is to be deployed and define the design requirements based on signal coverage and usage. Both methods automatically optimise and suggest a WLAN design that satisfies the user requirements. Both approaches have been implemented and evaluated based on signal coverage and maximum achievable throughput.\n",

            "Abstract: We describe a computer system that provides a real-time musical accompaniment for a live soloist in a piece of non-improvised music for soloist and accompaniment. A Bayesian network is developed that represents the joint distribution on the times at which the solo and accompaniment notes are played, relating the two parts through a layer of hidden variables. The network is first constructed using the rhythmic information contained in the musical score. The network is then trained to capture the musical interpretations of the soloist and accompanist in an off-line rehearsal phase. During live accompaniment the learned distribution of the network is combined with a real-time analysis of the soloist's acoustic signal, performed with a hidden Markov model, to generate a musically principled accompaniment that respects all available sources of knowledge. A live demonstration will be provided.\n",

            "Abstract: The merging of multiple range images obtained by 3D measurement systems for generating a single polygon mesh, and processing for filling holes caused by unmeasured data or insufficient range images are essential processes for CAD, digital archiving of shapes, and CG rendering. Many of the existing processes that have been proposed for merging and interpolating multiple shapes do not function well when the number of range images is small. In this paper, the space carving method is improved, and an interpolation algorithm is proposed which is capable of producing stable results even when the number of range images is small. In the proposed method, not only the observed voxels in a signed distance field, but also unseen voxels are determined as either inside or outside of an object using Bayes estimation. Characteristics of the proposed method include that closed surfaces are always obtained, and a GPU-based, efficient implementation is possible. In addition, in the case that the range image is obtained using an active stereo method, high precision estimation results can be achieved by using information regarding the light sources.\n",

            "Abstract: The problem of finding large complete subgraphs in bipartite graphs (that is, bicliques) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem referred to as the maximum-edge biclique problem (MBP), and has many applications, e.g., in web community discovery, biological data analysis and text mining. In this paper, we present a new continuous characterization for MBP. Given a bipartite graph $$G$$ , we are able to formulate a continuous optimization problem (namely, an approximate rank-one matrix factorization problem with nonnegativity constraints, R1N for short), and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between (1) the maximum (i.e., the largest) bicliques of $$G$$ and the global minima of R1N, and (2) the maximal bicliques of $$G$$ (i.e., bicliques not contained in any larger biclique) and the local minima of R1N. We also show that any stationary points of R1N must be close to a biclique of $$G$$ . This allows us to design a new type of biclique finding algorithm based on the application of a block-coordinate descent scheme to R1N. We show that this algorithm, whose algorithmic complexity per iteration is proportional to the number of edges in the graph, is guaranteed to converge to a biclique and that it performs competitively with existing methods on random graphs and text mining datasets. Finally, we show how R1N is closely related to the Motzkin---Strauss formalism for cliques.\n",

In this paper we present a novel algorithm designed for these conditions. We describe face data as resulting from a generative model which incorporates both within-individual and between-individual variation. In recognition we calculate the likelihood that the differences between face images are entirely due to within-individual variability. We extend this to the non-linear case where an arbitrary face manifold can be described and noise is position-dependent. We also develop a \"tied\" version of the algorithm that allows explicit comparison across quite different viewing conditions. We demonstrate that our model produces state of the art results for (i) frontal face recognition (ii) face recognition under varying pose.\n",

            "Abstract: While text versioning was definitely a part of the original hypertext concept [21, 36, 44], it is rarely considered in this context today. Still, we know that revision control underlies the most exciting social co-authoring projects of the today's Internet, namely the Wikipedia and the Linux kernel. With an intention to adapt the advanced revision control technologies and practices to the conditions of the Web, the paper reconsiders some obsolete assumptions and develops a new versioned text format perfectly processable with standard regular expressions (PCRE [6]). The resulting  deep  hypertext model allows instant access to past/concurrent versions, authorship, changes; enables deep links to reference changing parts of a changing text. Effectively, it allows distributed and real-time revision control on the Web, implementing the vision of co-evolution and mutation exchange among multiple competing versions of the same text.\n",

            "Abstract: A method for hypothesizing the locations of features that may have been undetected by low level three-dimensional image processing algorithms is presented. The procedure relies on a predicate logic based approach to object recognition in which viewpoint dependent (observed) data is transformed into a set of viewpoint independent assertions. The detected features in these viewpoint independent assertions are variabilized and the assertions are combined to form a clause which is then tested against known models for consistency. If the features in a known model are able to instantiate the free variables in the variabilized clause, then a subgraph isomorphism is established between the features in the observed data and those of the model. Missing or undetected features in the observed data are then sought by examining the semantic relationships between model features that are instantiated and those that are not. Results of applying the method to synthetic range data are presented.\n",

However, their computation appears highly demanding, as assessing whether an itemset is self-sufficient requires consideration of all pairwise partitions of the itemset into pairs of subsets as well as consideration of all supersets. This article presents the first published algorithm for efficiently discovering self-sufficient itemsets. This branch-and-bound algorithm deploys two powerful pruning mechanisms based on upper bounds on itemset value and statistical significance level. It demonstrates that finding top- k  productive and nonredundant itemsets, with postprocessing to identify those that are not independently productive, can efficiently identify small sets of key associations. We present extensive evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the technique, including comparisons with alternative approaches to finding the most interesting associations.\n",

            "Abstract: To fulfill the high data rate requirement of current telecommunication standards, error-correction codes decoders are implemented on parallel architectures leading to memory conflict problem. Different memory mapping approaches are proposed in the literature to solve this problem. However, these approaches can only be executed offline due to their computational complexity and resultant memory mapping is stored in dedicated ROM in order to drive the network for a particular block length. Unfortunately, to support several block lengths, multiple ROMs are required which results in huge hardware cost. In this article, we propose a novel online memory mapping architecture that consists of online mapping generator and RAM to support multiple block lengths on single chip. Online mapping generator performs two functions: First, it executes polynomial time memory mapping algorithm online and secondly, it generates command words for Benes network by using a simplified routing algorithm. Whenever new block length needs to be decoded, online mapping generator outputs addressing and command words at runtime to update the RAM. Experimental results show that significant reduction in time and memory cost is obtained while implementing polynomial time memory mapping algorithm on-chip as compared to state of the art approaches.\n",

            "Abstract: Two sides of a nite marriage market engage in costly investment and are then matched assortatively. The purpose of the investment is solely to improve the quality of the match that trader can attain in the second stage. The paper studies the limits of equilibrium of these nite matching games as the number of traders gets large and compares them with hedonic solutions to the pre-marital investment problem in which levels of the costly investment are implicitly priced. It is shown that equilibria of the simultaneous investment game do not converge to the hedonic solution. A sequential version of the game has approximate equilibria in which all trader invest as they would in the hedonic solution, but other approximate equilibria with ineciently large investment also occur in the sequential version of the game. This paper studies the pre-marital investment game. There are two sides to a potentially very large market. Traders on each side of the market try to match with traders on the other side. To inuence the outcome of the matching process, the traders make costly investments prior to the match in an attempt to make themselves more attractive as partners. Attention here is focussed on the case where investments are one dimensional and matching is assortative. Adding the pre-match investment phase turns this game into a prototype for a number of important applied problems. The problem that motivated this research is primarily the family matching problem studied in (Peters and Siow 1999), and the closely related marriage problem (Cole, Malaith, and Postlewaite 2000) or (Nosaka 2002) in which\n",

This paper reports measurements of force computation consistency under Windows 2000 and XP in single- and dual-processor systems. The median time was accurate at 1 ms. However, as the computation in the force loop increased to 500 /spl mu/s/iteration, release time jitter in the single-processor system increased up to 52%. Jitter was also introduced by network load. Contention from other real-time applications, such as audio and video display, dramatically increased the jitter, up to 100%. These high levels of jitter could perceptibly degrade force display for some tasks. Jitter was substantially lower for the dual-processor system. Haptic applications requiring consistent force computation should consider dual-processor configurations.\n",

In this paper, we propose a method to detect and track multiple moving biological objects showing different kind of dynamics in image sequences acquired through fluorescence video microscopy. It enables the extraction and analysis of informations such as number, position, speed and movement phases of, e.g., endosomes and viral particles. The method consists of four stages. After a detection stage performed by an undecimated wavelet transform, we compute, for each detected spot, several predictions of its future state in the next frame. This is accomplished thanks to an interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm which includes several models corresponding to different movement types. Tracks are constructed thereafter by a data association algorithm based on the maximization of the estimated likelihood of each IMM. The last stage consists in updating the IMM filters in order to compute final estimations for the present image and to improve predictions for the next image. The performance of the method is illustrated on synthetic image data.\n",

With a traditional PID controller, it will cause large overshoot or poor stability. In this paper, a fuzzy-PID controller is proposed in order to improve the performance of the servo system. The proposed controller incorporates the advantages of PID control which can eliminate the steady-state error, and the advantages of fuzzy logic such as simple design, no need of an accurate mathematical model and some adaptability to nonlinearity and time-variation. The fuzzy-PID controller accepts the error (e) and error change(e c ) as inputs ,while the parameters k p , k i , k d  as outputs. Control rules of the controller are established based on experience so that self-regulation of the values of PID parameters is achieved. A simulation model of position servo system is constructed in Matlab/Simulink module based on a high-speed milling machine researched in our institute. By comparing the traditional PID controller and the fuzzy-PID controller, the simulation results show that the system has stronger robustness and disturbance rejection capability with the latter controller which can meet the performance requirements of the CNC position servo system better\n",

This process is called information-problem solving (IPS). IPS can be characterized as a complex cognitive skill, which may need direct instruction to reach high levels of performance. However, IPS has been given little attention in schools, and instruction in this skill is rarely embedded in curricula. And yet, by giving students assignments in which students have to solve an information-based problem, teachers assume that their pupils have developed this skill naturally. A literature study was done to determine what kinds of problems students experience when solving information problems using the WWW for searching information, and what kind of instructional support can help to solve these problems. Results show that children, teenagers and adults have trouble with specifying search terms, judging search results and judging source and information. Regulating the search process is also problematic. Instruction designed specifically for IPS using the WWW for searching information is rare but indeed addresses the problematic skills. However, there are differences between various methods and it is unclear which method is most effective for specific age groups.\n",

For concave or cyclic meshes, however, a signicant overhead is required to sort the grid cells in back to front order. In this paper we apply methods known from computational geometry to transform concave into convex grids. While this issue has been studied in theory it has not yet been applied to the specic area of unstructured volume rendering. This is mainly due to the complexity of the required geometrical operations. We demonstrate that the convexication of concave grids can be achieved by a combination of simple operations on triangle meshes. For convexied meshes the experimental results show that the performance penalty is only about 70% in comparison to approximately 300% for the fastest known concave sorting algorithm. In order to achieve high-quality visualizations we also adapt the preintegrated lighting technique to cell projection.\n",

In spatial network activity summarization (SNAS), we are given a spatial network and a collection of activities (e.g., pedestrian fatality reports, crime reports) and the goal is to find    \\(k\\)    shortest paths that summarize the activities. SNAS is important for applications where observations occur along linear paths such as roadways, train tracks, etc. SNAS is computationally challenging because of the large number of    \\(k\\)    subsets of shortest paths in a spatial network. Previous work has focused on either geometry or subgraph-based approaches (e.g., only one path), and cannot summarize activities using multiple paths. This paper proposes a K-Main Routes (KMR) approach that discovers    \\(k\\)    shortest paths to summarize activities. KMR generalizes K-means for network space but uses shortest paths instead of ellipses to summarize activities. To improve performance, KMR uses network Voronoi, divide and conquer, and pruning strategies. We present a case study comparing KMR's network-based output (i.e., shortest paths) to geometry-based outputs (e.g., ellipses) on pedestrian fatality data. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that KMR with our performance-tuning decisions yields substantial computational savings without reducing summary path coverage.\n",

This contribution describes the open source project Edutella which builds upon metadata standards defined for the WWW and aims to provide an RDF-based metadata infrastructure for P2P applications, building on the recently announced JXTA Framework.

Algorithms are then presented to test the entire network using at most twice the number of tests needed to test a switch, independently of the network size, which results in O(log N) testing time for an N-processor network. It is shown that the method achieves higher coverage and several-orders-of-magnitude reduction in the testing time of complex multiprocessor systems compared to previous methods. >\n",

The first technique is based on a correlation of the MPEG7 Dominant Color Descriptor (DC) [6] as single characteristic feature of a shot. The second approach is to model color pattern distribution in a shot with a codebook, obtained by VQ (Vector Quantization) of the frame blocks composing the shot. The last one models the color pattern distribution using a GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model). Such descriptors are used to establish correspondence between non consecutive camera records through an appropriately designed similarity measure. As such, a new distance measure is used in the comparison between the shot descriptors, by extending the metric proposed in [9]. A comparison is made of the dissimilarity performance associated with each of the three proposed descriptors, demonstrating the superior results obtainable with the VQ based approach.\n",

            "Abstract: A wireless ad-hoc network is a collection of transceivers positioned in the plane. Each transceiver is equipped with a limited battery charge. The battery charge is then reduced after each transmission, depending on the transmission distance. One of the major problems in wireless network design is to route network traffic efficiently so as to maximize the network lifetime, i.e., the number of successful transmissions. In this paper we consider Rooted Maximum Lifetime Broadcast/Convergecast problems in wireless settings. The instance consists of a directed graph G = (V,E) with edge-weights {w(e) : e ? E}, node capacities {b(v) : v ? V}, and a root r. The goal is to find a maximum size collection {T 1, ..., T k } of Broadcast/Convergecast trees rooted at r so that $\\sum_{i=1}^k w(\\delta_{T_i}(v)) \\leq b(v)$, where ? T (v) is the set of edges leaving v in T. In the Single Topology version all the Broadcast/Convergecast trees T i are identical. We present a number of polynomial time algorithms giving constant ratio approximation for various broadcast and convergecast problems, improving previously known result of $\\Omega(\\lfloor 1/\\log n \\rfloor)$-approximation by [1]. We also consider a generalized Rooted Maximum Lifetime Mixedcast problem, where we are also given an integer ? ? 0, and the goal is to find the maximum integer k so that k Broadcast and ?k Convergecast rounds can be performed.\n",

It is a valuable tool in representing a whole set of objects by a single prototype, and has interesting applications in pattern recognition. All algorithms for computing generalised median strings known from the literature are of static nature. That is, they require all elements of the underlying set of strings to be given when the algorithm is started. In this paper, we present a novel approach that is able to operate in a dynamic environment, where there is a steady arrival of new strings belonging to the considered set. Rather than computing the median from scratch upon arrival of each new string, the proposed algorithm needs only the median of the set computed before together with the new string to compute an updated median string of the new set. Our approach is experimentally compared to a greedy algorithm and the set median using both synthetic and real data.\n",

            "Abstract: The access of multimedia computing in wireless networks is concerned with the efficiency of handoff because of the irretrievable property of real-time data delivery. To lessen throughput degradation leading to media computing disruption perceived by users, this paper presents a link quality based handoff algorithm. Neural networks are used to learn the correlation between link quality estimator and the corresponding context metric indictors. Based on a pre-processed learning of link quality profile, neural networks make efficient handoff decisions with an evaluation of link quality instead of a comparison between relative signal strength. The experimental and simulation results show that the number of lost packets is minimized using the proposed algorithm without incurring unnecessary handoffs.\n",

Nevertheless, there is still much debate on the best ways to process data, to design experiments and analyse the output. Furthermore, many of the more sophisticated mathematical approaches to data analysis in the literature remain inaccessible to much of the biological research community. In this study we examine ways of extracting and analysing a large data set obtained using the Agilent long oligonucleotide transcriptomics platform, applied to a set of human macrophage and dendritic cell samples.\n",

            "Abstract: Identification of the factors involved in deforestation could lead to a comprehensive understanding of deforestation on a broad scale, as well as a prediction capability. Tanaka and Nishii [7, 8] explored regression models with two explanatory variables - human population density (N) and relief energy (R), i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum altitudes in a sampled area- as to whether they could elucidate aspects of deforestation. As relative appropriateness of the models, Akaike's Information Criterion was used to evaluate the models on real data. Although they suceeded in identifying the fuctional form of g(N) in Asian four test areas, the topographic term h(R) remained intact in terms of alternative possible variable forms. In this research, detailed verifications of the topographic feature were employed, and it was revealed that addition of mean altitude on the same cell will give great improvement to the model.\n",

            "Abstract: In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus constitutes the central circadian pacemaker. The SCN receives light signals from the retina and controls peripheral circadian clocks (located in the cortex, the pineal gland, the liver, the kidney, the heart, etc.). This hierarchical organization of the circadian system ensures the proper timing of physiological processes. In each SCN neuron, interconnected transcriptional and translational feedback loops enable the circadian expression of the clock genes. Although all the neurons have the same genotype, the oscillations of individual cells are highly heterogeneous in dispersed cell culture: many cells present damped oscillations and the period of the oscillations varies from cell to cell. In addition, the neurotransmitters that ensure the intercellular coupling, and thereby the synchronization of the cellular rhythms, differ between the two main regions of the SCN. In this work, a mathematical model that accounts for this heterogeneous organization of the SCN is presented and used to study the implication of the SCN network topology on synchronization and entrainment properties. The results show that oscillations with larger amplitude can be obtained with scale-free networks, in contrast to random and local connections. Networks with the small-world property such as the scale-free networks used in this work can adapt faster to a delay or advance in the light/dark cycle (jet lag). Interestingly a certain level of cellular heterogeneity is not detrimental to synchronization performances, but on the contrary helps resynchronization after jet lag. When coupling two networks with different topologies that mimic the two regions of the SCN, efficient filtering of pulse-like perturbations in the entrainment pattern is observed. These results suggest that the complex and heterogeneous architecture of the SCN decreases the sensitivity of the network to short entrainment perturbations while, at the same time, improving its adaptation abilities to long term changes.\n",

            "Abstract: Many algorithms have been proposed for processing multiple XPath Expressions such as Xfilter[5], Yfilter[6], turboXPath[13] and Xtrie[9]. But they do not deal with backward axes. XAOS[2] deals with XPath expressions with forward and backward axes (such as parent and ancestor). But XAOS deals with only one query at a time. As a result a document is parsed q times for a set of q queries, which is a significant cost in terms of time. More over, in a large-scale system, there is bound to be substantial commonality among different queries. In this paper, we present a method called YALXP, which attempts to evaluate multiple queries, with both forward and backward axes, in less number of passes exploiting commonality among the queries. Our method is built upon XAOS algorithm. Our experiments show that YALXP performs better in CPU time and memory than traditional XPath engine Xalan (ODP) – for multiple queries with single DOM construction.\n",

A model explaining the impact of different factors on online shopping intentions and behavior is developed based on the theory of planned behavior. The model is then tested empirically in a longitudinal study with two surveys. Data collected from 705 consumers indicate that subjective norms, attitude, and beliefs concerning the consequences of online shopping have significant effects on consumers' intentions to buy online. Behavioral control and intentions significantly influenced online shopping behavior. The results also provide strong support for the positive effects of personal innovativeness on attitude and intentions to shop online.

It has difficulty in localizing failures in the PV system for maintenance. To overcome this, we propose a PLC-based management scheme that consists of a PLC modem, a renewable energy gateway (REG), and a smart device application. The PLC modems measure the status of PV modules. The REG aggregates the measured status values from the PLC modems. The smart device application displays the status of the whole PV system. A user can easily localize failures in the PV system for better performance and maintenance. The proposed scheme enhances a PV system management and can create synergy with smart home energy management system.\n",

The random deletion channel takes n symbols from a q-ary alphabet, and each symbol is deleted independently with probability p. Taking advantage of recent improvements on the results of Luby and Mitzenmacher for verification-based decoding by Shokrollahi and Wang, we show how to design for any epsi>0 and sufficiently large n and q deletion codes with the following properties: the rate is (1-p)(1-epsi), the failure probability is n O(1/epsi2) /q, and the computational complexity for encoding and decoding is n O(1/epsi2) log q. We also extend these schemes to obtain the same results even if the undeleted symbols are also transposed arbitrarily, and if a sufficiently small number of random symbols are inserted\n",

            "Abstract: A knowledge-based agent was designed and validated to optimally re-distribute control authority in a torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The objective is greater fault tolerance in AUVs on long deployments when an AUV is unexpectedly underactuated from a jammed control fin. The optimization is achieved through a genetic algorithm that evaluates solutions based on a full non-linear analysis of the AUV dynamics and control. The agent is implemented on-board the AUV to provide timely reassignment of the fin control authority (gains) while underway so that the mission can continue or a potential vehicle loss be averted. The effectiveness of the agent is assessed through a parametric analysis that compares the response of the unexpectedly underactuated AUV with its initial gains against the optimized gains. The agent's greatest impact is in the event of a bow fin jam as the remaining functional planes maintain depth better with the agent's help. The ability to provide a timely and on-board optimal solution that adapts to a fin jam is a higher level of autonomy than has been previously reported.\n",

            "Abstract: Transmitter channel state information (CSIT) is crucial for the multiplexing gains offered by advanced interference management techniques such as multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and interference alignment. Such CSIT is usually obtained by feedback from the receivers, but the feedback is subject to delays. The usual approach is to use the fed back information to predict the current channel state and then apply a scheme designed assuming perfect CSIT. When the feedback delay is large compared to the channel coherence time, such a prediction approach completely fails to achieve any multiplexing gain. In this paper, we show that even in this case, the completely stale CSI is still very useful. More concretely, we show that in an MIMO broadcast channel with transmit antennas and receivers each with 1 receive antenna, K/1+1/2+···+1/K (>;1) degrees of freedom is achievable even when the fed back channel state is completely independent of the current channel state. Moreover, we establish that if all receivers have independent and identically distributed channels, then this is the optimal number of degrees of freedom achievable. In the optimal scheme, the transmitter uses the fed back CSI to learn the side information that the receivers receive from previous transmissions rather than to predict the current channel state. Our result can be viewed as the first example of feedback providing a degree-of-freedom gain in memoryless channels.\n",

Recently there has been some interest in designing time-variant serial FIR (finite impulse response) decision feedback equalizers (DFE) using complex exponential (CE-) BEMs for equalizers in addition to using CE-BEM for modeling the channel itself. In this paper we show that an alternative formulation of the FIR DFE based on a CE-BEM channel model yields the same or an improved BER at a lower computational cost, without incuring the approximation error inherent in CE-BEM modeling of equalizers.\n",

            "Abstract: Intrusion detection systems monitor protected networks and attempt to identify evidence of malicious activity. When an attack is detected, an alert is produced, and, possibly, a countermeasure is executed. A perfect intrusion detection system would be able to identify all the attacks without raising any false alarms. In addition, a countermeasure would be executed only when an attack is actually successful. Unfortunately false alarms are commonplace in intrusion detection systems, and perfectly benign events are interpreted as malicious. In addition, non-relevant alerts are also common. These are alerts associated with attacks that were not successful. Such alerts should be tagged appropriately so that their priority can be lowered. The process of identifying alerts associated with successful attacks is called alert verification. This paper describes the different issues involved in alert verification and presents a tool that performs real-time verification of attacks detected by an intrusion detection system. The experimental evaluation of the tool shows that verification can dramatically reduce both false and non-relevant alerts.\n",

            "Abstract: Scenario-based optimization is a problem class often occurring in finance, planning and control. While the standard approach is usually based on linear stochastic programming, this paper develops an Evolution Strategy (ES) that can be used to treat nonlinear planning problems arising from Value at Risk (VaR)-constraints and not necessarily proportional transaction costs. Due to the VaR-constraints the optimization problem is generally of non-convex type and its decision version is already NP-complete. The developed ES is the first algorithm in the field of evolutionary and swarm intelligence that tackles this kind of optimization problem. The algorithm design is based on the covariance matrix self-adaptation ES (CMSA-ES). The optimization is performed on scenario trees where in each node specific constraints (balance equations) must be fulfilled. In order to evaluate the performance of the ES proposed, instances of increasing problem hardness are considered. The application to the general case with nonlinear node constraints shows not only the potential of the ES designed, but also its limitations. The latter are basically determined by the high dimensionalities of the search spaces defined by the scenario trees.\n",

Robustness study of recurrent neural network is critical to its successful implementation. The goal of robustness study is to reduce the sensitivity of modeling capability to parametric uncertainties or make the network fault tolerant.

An uncertainty propagation analysis-based robustness measure has been proposed accordingly and further compared with available performance loss-based and sensitivity matrix-based approaches. Results show that the proposed robustness measure approach is more efficient, generic, and flexible to quantify the robustness of a recurrent neural network.\n",

In our study, we assume that the network handles three types of call: real time voice calls, non-real time data calls with guaranteed bandwidth and non-real time elastic data calls. A Markovian modelling approach is used to analyse the bandwidth occupation and derive the analytical model for the RA scheme.\n",

            "Abstract: The paper presents a low-cost multiple gas sensing device developed for pollution measurements in a kitchen hood which is exposed to grease and dirt. The target application of an ozone control system needs no accurate measurements. Using common electronics for all three sensing elements reduces costs. A single digital processor with a user friendly interface controls the heating power of the sensing elements and reads the measurements. Two sensors can be connected to a single personal computer (PC). The main task of the sensor system is to observe volatile organic compounds (VOC) from cooking emissions and measure the ozone produced in the outlet duct. The sensor gives the total non-specific VOC amount and is not intended for a particular gas. Calibration with ethanol guarantees a representative enough response for most hydrocarbons in cooking emissions. The sensing devices give an indication if more ozone is needed. Practical tests show that the response of the first VOC element is slow but stable, while the second one reacts rapidly (<1 s) to any changes. The combination of the sensing elements gives a very good estimate of the total VOC level. The ozone sensing element also reacts to VOCs, which is a harmful characteristic for the prospective ozone control mechanism. However, with a combination of the VOC and ozone measurements, the errors in the ozone measurement can be reduced. Thus the sensor is like a simple electronic nose (Marco, S. et al., 1998).\n",

To reduce the expensive cost, we adopt the profile-based approach to design a behavior-based strategy (BBS) based on the moving behavior of each mobile generated by long-term collection of its moving history. We use a data mining technique to mine the moving behavior of each mobile and then estimate the probability that each mobile stays in each location at each time region given the last known location from its moving behavior. To reduce unnecessary computation, we consider the location tracking and computational cost and then derie a cost model. A greedy heuristic is proposed to minimize the cost modle through finding the appropriate checkpoints. The experimental results show our strategy outperforms fixed paging area strategy currently used in GSM or IS-54 system and time-based strategy for highly regular moving mobiles.\n",

Our model takes into account the variability of local descriptors, their saliency as well as the probability of spatial configurations. It is structured to clearly separate the probability of point-wise correspondences from the spatial coherence of sets of correspondences. For each descriptor of the query image, several correspondences in the image database exist. Each of these point-wise correspondences is weighted by its variability and its saliency. We then search for sets of correspondences which reinforce each other, that is which are spatially coherent. The recognized model is the one which obtains the highest evidence from these sets. To validate our probabilistic model, it is compared to an existing method for image retrieval. The experimental results are given for a database containing more than 1000 images. They clearly show the significant gain obtained by adding the probabilistic model.\n",

            "Abstract: How does one locate the segments of code that implement a particular feature? N. Wilde and M.C. Scully (WS) (1995) pioneered the use of execution traces to map program features to code. Using their technique to locate the implementation of a particular feature, a program is executed with two sets of inputs; one set invokes the feature of interest and the other set does not. Operations such as set-difference and set-intersection, amongst others, are then applied on the execution traces to obtain answers for various questions related to a feature and its implementation. Previous researchers have automated the tasks of computing the execution traces and performing operations on the execution traces. We present a formalism to automate the most time-consuming aspect of this approach for locating code, namely, the partitioning of the input sets into invoking and non-invoking sets. A collection of input sets is partitioned using feature syntax, a grammar of the program's input annotated with feature names. An input set is placed in the invoking set if and only if its parse tree is annotated with that feature. WS' technique solely applies set operations on the execution traces of inputs. In our technique, we also apply the set operations among the set of features used by these inputs. By doing so, we can precisely determine the features whose implementation is identified when applying the operations on the execution traces.\n",

The main objectives of the proposed hashing method are to show robustness against content-preserved attacks and to enable blind-detection without using any preprocessing techniques for the attacks. To achieve these objectives, the proposed hashing method projects all vertices to the shape coordinates of 3D SSD and curvedness, and then, it segments the shape coordinates into rectangular blocks and computes the block shape intensity using a permutation key and a random key. A hash is generated by binarizing the block shape intensity.

The dynamic system state is a low-dimensional representation of the boundary, and boundary estimation involves incorporating curve evolution into state estimation. By formulating the problem as one of state estimation, the segmentation at each particular time is based not only on the data observed at that instant, but also on predictions based on past and future boundary estimates.

Moreover, exposure of unprotected authentication data is a high risk threat for organizations with online presence. The challenge is how to ensure security of multi-factor authentication data without deteriorating the performance of an identity verification system? To solve this problem, we present a novel framework that applies random projections to biometric data (inherence factor), using secure keys derived from passwords (knowledge factor), to generate inherently secure, efficient and revocable/renewable biometric templates for users' verification. We evaluate the security strength of the framework against possible attacks by adversaries. We also undertake a case study of deploying the proposed framework in a two-factor authentication setup that uses users' passwords and dynamic handwritten signatures. Our system preserves the important biometric information even when the user specific password is compromised - a highly desirable feature but not existent in the state-of-the-art transformation techniques. We have evaluated the performance of the framework on three publicly available signature datasets. The results prove that the proposed framework does not undermine the discriminating features of genuine and forged signatures and the verification performance is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art benchmark results.

However, due to the prohibitive simulation time of commercial workloads, it is extremely difficult to use them in computer architecture research. In this paper, we study the efficacy of using statistical sampling-based simulation methodology for two classes of commercial workloads: a Java server benchmark SPECjbb2000 and an online transaction processing (OLTP) benchmark DBT-2. Our results show that, although SPECjbb2000 shows distinct garbage collection phases, there are no large-scale phases in the OLTP benchmark. We take advantage of this stationary behavior in the steady phase and propose a statistical sampling-based simulation technique DynaSim with two dynamic stopping rules. In this approach, the simulation terminates once the target accuracy has been met. We apply DynaSim to simulate commercial workloads and show that, with the simulation of only a few million total instructions, the error can be within 3 percent, at a confidence level of 99 percent. DynaSim compares favorably with random sampling and representative sampling in terms of the total number of instructions simulated (time cost) and with representative sampling in terms of the number of checkpoints (storage cost). DynaSim increases the usability of a sampling-based simulation approach for commercial workloads and will encourage the use of commercial workloads in computer architecture research.\n",

            "Abstract: Several studies have shown the importance of two very different descriptors for shape: symmetry structure and curvature extrema. The main theorem proved by this paper, i.e. the Symmetry-Curvature Duality Theorem, states that there is an important relationship between symmetry and curvature extrema: If we say that curvature extrema are of two opposite types, either maxima or minima, then the theorem states: Any segment of a smooth planar curve, bounded by two consecutive curvature extrema of the same type, has a unique symmetry axis, and the axis terminates at the curvature extremum of the opposite type. The theorem is initially proved using Brady’s SLS as the symmetry analysis. However, the theorem is then generalized for any differential symmetry analysis. In order to prove the theorem, a number of results are established concerning the symmetry structure of Hoffman’s and Richards’ codons. All results are obtained first by observing that any codon is a string of two, three, or four spirals, and then by reducing the theory of codons to that of spirals. We show that the SLS of a codon is either (1) an SAT, which is a more restricted symmetry analysis that was introduced by Blum, or (2) an ESAT, which is a symmetry analysis that is introduced in the present paper and is dual to Blum’s SAT. c 1987 Academic Press, Inc.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents  CHeckpointed Early Resource RecYcling (Cherry) , a hybrid mode of execution based on ROB and checkpointing that decouples resource recycling and instruction retirement. Resources are recycled early, resulting in a more efficient utilization. Cherry relies on state checkpointing and rollback to service exceptions for instructions whose resources have been recycled. Cherry leverages the ROB to (1) not require in-order execution as a fallback mechanism, (2) allow memory replay traps and branch mispredictions without rolling back to the Cherry checkpoint, and (3) quickly fall back to conventional out-of-order execution without rolling back to the checkpoint or flushing the pipeline.We present a Cherry implementation with early recycling at three different points of the execution engine: the load queue, the store queue, and the register file. We report average speedups of 1.06 and 1.26 in SPECint and SPECfp applications, respectively, relative to an aggressive conventional architecture. We also describe how Cherry and speculative multithreading can be combined and complement each other.\n",

By using category relevance factors, CRF computes the feature vectors of training documents belonging to the same category. Based on these feature vectors, CRF induces the profile vector of each category. For new unlabelled documents, CRF adopts a modified cosine measure to obtain similarities between these documents and categories and assigns them to categories that have the biggest similarity scores. In CRF, it is profile vectors not vectors of all training documents that join in computing the similarities between documents and categories. We evaluated our algorithm on a subset of Reuters-21578 and 20_newsgroups text collections and compared it against k-NN and SVM. Experimental results show that CRF outperforms k-NN and is competitive with SVM.\n",

This algorithm suffers from several drawbacks that result in its poor performance in difficult situations. To improve its performance in those situations, like junctions and varying road characteristics, we propose to use the unscented Kalman filter which can deal better with the nonlinearity of the road model. Additionally, we use an approach to dissociate the system measurements from the current state prediction of the Kalman filter. This method removes the potential for the instability of the algorithm. Finally, we introduce a technique based on clustering of the road profiles to properly maintain a database on various road characteristics along the way. This way we provide a means to continue tracking even when the road profile undergoes significant variations.\n",

From a content-based point of view, this task can be regarded as obtaining a suitable distance measurement between songs defined on a certain feature space. We propose two such distance measures. First, a low-level measure based on tempo-related aspects, and second, a high-level semantic measure based on regression by support vector machines of different groups of musical dimensions such as genre and culture, moods and instruments, or rhythm and tempo. We evaluate these distance measures against a number of state-of-the-art measures objectively, based on 17 ground truth musical collections, and subjectively, based on 12 listeners’ ratings. Results show that, in spite of being conceptually different, the proposed methods achieve comparable or even higher performance than the considered baseline approaches. Furthermore, they open up the possibility to explore distance metrics that are based on truly semantic notions.\n",

However when optical flow, which is often used for vision-based control, is computed by the conventional methods using such an image sequence, the result contains significant error because there is almost no variance between any two successive image frames. To deal with this problem, we propose temporally evaluated optical flow, which we compute by measuring the time required for each pixel to move a fixed distance using temporally consistent shifts of each pixel. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves accuracy and is superior to the conventional methods in terms of robustness.\n",

            "Abstract: Phase Change Memory (PCM) has recently attracted a lot of attention as a scalable alternative to DRAM for main memory systems. As the need for high-density memory increases, DRAM has proven to be less attractive from the point of view of scaling and energy consumption. PCM-only memories suffer from latency issues, high write energy, and the problem of limited write endurance. Research in this domain has focused mainly on using various hybrid memory configurations to address these shortcomings. A commodity DRAM module as a cache for PCM memory has emerged as a potential solution. But this method requires use of a separate memory controller and is unable to achieve better performance than a DRAM-only based memory at low energy. We propose a PCM based main memory system design using a small, embedded DRAM (eDRAM) cache to replace the row buffers in the PCM memory chip. This reduces the high latencies of PCM and the energy consumption of the main memory system. Our methodology also eliminates the need for separate memory controllers. Through simulation results, we show competitive performance by reducing average memory access time of a slow PCM based memory and significant energy reductions against a DDR3 commodity DRAM memory system of similar storage size. Our proposed system is highly energy efficient and provides 35.02%improvement in EDP over a DRAM-only system. Our system consumes less energy than the state-of-the-art PCM hybrid system using a commodity DRAM cache.\n",

For this to happen it is imperative that the spatial interactions are sufficiently strong. So far, this scenario of generating chaos from simple local dynamics has been established rigorously only for special, very narrow classes of local maps. The present article largely extends previous results by showing that the corresponding mechanism of peak-crossing is in fact very general and robust: whenever the local map is sufficiently expanding and exhibits a horseshoe then the emergence of spatial intermittency will be observed in the form of chaotically oscillating sites surrounded by quasi-regular clusters. The results firmly establish peak-crossing as a natural scenario on the route to spacetime chaos.\n",

            "Abstract: Sensory systems have evolved to respond to input stimuli of certain statistical properties, and to reliably transmit this information through biochemical pathways. Hence, for an experimentally well-characterized sensory system, one ought to be able to extract valuable information about the statistics of the stimuli. Based on dose-response curves from in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments of the bacterial chemotaxis sensory system, we predict the chemical gradients chemotactic Escherichia coli cells typically encounter in their natural environment. To predict average gradients cells experience, we revaluate the phenomenological Weber's law and its generalizations to the Weber-Fechner law and fold-change detection. To obtain full distributions of gradients we use information theory and simulations, considering limitations of information transmission from both cell-external and internal noise. We identify broad distributions of exponential gradients, which lead to log-normal stimuli and maximal drift velocity. Our results thus provide a first step towards deciphering the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible cellular microenvironments, such as the human intestine.\n",

            "Abstract: We present a framework for the holographic representation and display of graphics objects. As opposed to traditional graphics representations, our approach reconstructs the light wave reflected or emitted by the original object directly from the underlying digital hologram. Our novel holographic graphics pipeline consists of several stages including the digital recording of a full-parallax hologram, the reconstruction and propagation of its wavefront, and rendering of the final image onto conventional, framebuffer-based displays. The required view-dependent depth image is computed from the phase information inherently represented in the complex-valued wavefront. Our model also comprises a correct physical modeling of the camera taking into account optical elements, such as lens and aperture. It thus allows for a variety of effects including depth of field, diffraction, interference, and features built-in anti-aliasing. A central feature of our framework is its seamless integration into conventional rendering and display technology which enables us to elegantly combine traditional 3D object or scene representations with holograms. The presented work includes the theoretical foundations and allows for high quality rendering of objects consisting of large numbers of elementary waves while keeping the hologram at a reasonable size\n",

            "Abstract: Although it is well documented that children undergo a productive vocabulary spurt late in the second year, it is unclear whether this development is accompanied by equally significant advances in receptive word processing. In the present study, we tested an electrophysiological procedure for assessing receptive word learning in young children, and the impact of productive vocabulary size for performance in this task. We found that 20-month-olds with high productive vocabularies displayed an N400 incongruity effect to violations of trained associations between novel words and pictures, whereas 20-month-olds with low productive vocabularies did not. However, both high and low producers showed an N400 effect for common real words paired with an incongruous object. These findings indicate that there may be substantial differences in receptive fast mapping efficiency between typically developing children who have reached a productive vocabulary spurt and typically developing children who have not yet reached this productive spurt.\n",

            "Abstract: In many computer vision systems, it is assumed that the image brightness of a point directly reflects the scene radiance of the point. However, the assumption does not hold in most cases due to nonlinear camera response function, exposure changes, and vignetting. The effects of these factors are most visible in image mosaics and textures of 3D models where colors look inconsistent and notable boundaries exist. In this paper, we propose a full radiometric calibration algorithm that includes robust estimation of the radiometric response function, exposures, and vignetting. By decoupling the effect of vignetting from the response function estimation, we approach each process in a manner that is robust to noise and outliers. We verify our algorithm with both synthetic and real data, which shows significant improvement compared to existing methods. We apply our estimation results to radiometrically align images for seamless mosaics and 3D model textures. We also use our method to create high dynamic range (HDR) mosaics that are more representative of the scene than normal mosaics.\n",

Here, f is a convex function aiming to promote the structure of x_0, say l_1-norm to promote sparsity or nuclear norm to promote low-rankness. We assume that the entries of A are independent and normally distributed and make no assumptions on the noise vector z, other than it being independent of A. Under this generic setup, we derive a general, non-asymptotic and rather tight upper bound on the l_2-norm of the estimation error ∥x̂ - x0∥2. Our bound is geometric in nature and obeys a simple formula; the roles of λ, f and x_0 are all captured by a single summary parameter δ(λ∂f(x_0)), termed the Gaussian squared distance to the scaled subdifferential. We connect our result to the literature and verify its validity through simulations.\n",

            "Abstract: In cognitive networks, since nodes generally belong to different authorities and pursue different goals, they will not cooperate with others unless cooperation can improve their own performance. Thus, how to stimulate cooperation among nodes in cognitive networks is very important. However, most of existing game-theoretic cooperation stimulation approaches rely on the assumption that the interactions between any pair of players are long-lasting. When this assumption is not true, according to the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma and the backward induction principle, the unique Nash equilibrium (NE) is to always play non-cooperatively. In this paper, we propose a cooperation stimulation scheme for the scenario where the number of interactions between any pair of players are finite. The proposed algorithm is based on indirect reciprocity game modelling where the key concept is \"I help you not because you have helped me but because you have helped others\". We formulate the problem of finding the optimal action rule as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a modified value iteration algorithm to find the optimal action rule. Using the packet forwarding game as an example, we show that with an appropriate cost-to-gain ratio, the strategy of forwarding the number of packets that is equal to the reputation level of the receiver is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). Finally, simulations are shown to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n",

Vague sets are suitable for accurately describing the uncertain information. Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory is a promising method for the combination of evidence obtained from different source. A new approach is proposed by combining vague sets and D-S theory as there are some similarities between these two theories. By the use of vague sets, characteristics of the factors related to evaluate a component could be described in crisp form and can be represented using belief and plausibility functions defined in D-S theory. Then they are combined using an enhanced weight normalized combination algorithm based on D-S evidence combination rule to reduce the incompleteness and uncertainty. An example is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. According to its firm mathematical foundation, the proposed approach can be applied to any bodies of multi-source information fusion without changing the recursive combination algorithm.\n",

            "Abstract: The charging power of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) decreases significantly when the state of charge (SoC) gets closer to the fully charged state, which leads to a longer charging duration. Each time when the battery is charged at high rates, it incurs a significant degradation cost that shortens the battery life. Furthermore, the differences between demand preferences, battery types, and charging technologies make the operation of the charging stations a complex problem. Even though some of these issues have been addressed in the literature, the charging station modeling with battery models and different customer preferences have been neglected. To that end, this paper proposes two queueing-based optimization frameworks. In the first one, the goal is to maximize the system revenue for single class customers by limiting the requested SoC targets. The PEV cost function is composed of battery degradation cost, the waiting cost in the queue, and the admission fee. Under this framework, the charging station is modeled as a    $M/G/S/K$    queue, and the system performance is assessed based on the numerical and simulation results. In the second framework, we describe an optimal revenue model for multi-class PEVs, building upon the approach utilized in the first framework. Two charging strategies are proposed: 1) a dedicated charger model and 2) a shared charger model for the multi-class PEVs. We evaluate and compare these strategies. Results show that the proposed frameworks improve both the station performance and quality of service provided to customers. The results show that the system revenue is more than doubled when compared with the baseline scenario which includes no limitations on the requested SoC.\n",

The feature landmark database is used to estimate camera positions and postures for various applications such as augmented reality systems and self-localization of robots and automobiles. We have already proposed a camera position and posture estimation method using landmark database that stores 3D positions of sparse feature points with their view-dependent image templates. For large environments, the cost for construction of landmark database is high because conventional 3-D reconstruction methods requires measuring some absolute positions of feature points manually to suppress accumulative estimation errors in structure-from-motion process. To achieve automatic construction of landmark database for large outdoor environments, we newly propose a method that constructs database without manual specification of features using omnidirectional videos and GPS positions.\n",

            "Abstract: A  Process-Aware Information System  (PAIS) is a software system that manages and executes operational processes involving people, applications, and/or information sources on the basis of process models. Example PAISs are workflow management systems, case-handling systems, enterprise information systems, etc. This paper provides a brief introduction to these systems and discusses the role of process models in the PAIS life-cycle. Moreover, it provides a  critical reflection on the state-of-the-art based on experiences with process mining  . Process mining techniques attempt to extract non-trivial and useful information from event logs. One aspect of process mining is control-flow discovery, i.e., automatically constructing a process model (e.g., a Petri net) describing the causal dependencies between activities. The insights provided by process mining are very valuable for the development of the next generation PAISs because they clearly show a mismatch between the models proposed for driving these systems and reality. On the one hand, models tend to oversimplify things resulting in systems that are too restrictive. On the other hand, models fail to capture important aspects of business processes.\n",

            "Abstract: Planning for the optimal attainment of requirements is an important early lifecycle activity. However, such planning is difficult when dealing with competing requirements, limited resources, and the incompleteness of information available at requirements time. A novel approach to requirements optimization is described. A requirements interaction model is executed to randomly sample the space of options. This produces a large amount of data, which is then condensed by a summarization tool. The result is a small list of critical decisions (i.e., those most influential in leading towards the desired optimum). This focuses human experts' attention on a relatively few decisions and makes them aware of major alternatives. This approach is iterative. Each iteration allows experts to select from among the major alternatives. In successive iterations the execution and summarization modules are run again, but each time further constrained by the decisions made in previous iteration. In the case study shown here, out of 99 yes/no decisions (approximately 10/sup 30/ possibilities), five iterations were sufficient to find and make the 30 key ones.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents Customer Satisfaction (CS) based resource allocation strategy in orthogonal frequency- division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless system with multimedia traffic. The risk aversion utility functions are analyzed, based on which, the CS utility and the CS resource allocation strategy are proposed. Compared with the Proportional Fairness (PF) utility, the CS utility enables the system to adjust its resource allocation according to both the traffic requirements and the resource situation. Numerical results demonstrate that the CS resource allocation strategy outperforms the PF strategy in both real-time (RT) traffic and best effort (BE) traffic. I. INTRODUCTION Due to the scarce resources and fading channel, the allo- cation and management of resources are crucial in wireless networks. OFDM is a well accepted technology that combats the deficits of fading channel by converting a frequency selec- tive fading channel into several flat fading channels (1). In an OFDM wireless network, different subcarriers can be allocated to different users to provide a flexible multiuser access scheme and to exploit multiuser diversity. In addition, it is believed that supporting multimedia traffic is an indispensable requirement in future-generation wireless networks (2). Hence, it becomes necessary and significant to investigate the resource allocation in OFDM based wireless multimedia system. Traditionally, resource allocation focuses on improving spectral efficiency, which is unfair to those users under bad channel conditions. In contrast, absolute fairness may lead to low bandwidth efficiency. Therefore, an effective tradeoff be- tween efficiency and fairness is desired in radio resource allo- cation (3,4). These issues have been well studied in economics, where utility functions are used to quantify the effectiveness of the usage of certain resources. Similarly, utility theory can be used in communication networks to evaluate the capability a network owns to satisfy the service requirements of various applications. The introduction of utility theory is a milestone to the research of resource allocation and management. Proportional Fairness (PF) utility is originally proposed by Frank Kelly in the context of rate control in wired net- works (3). Maximizing the logarithmic utility function U = PK i=1 ln(Ti) ,w hereTi is the throughput of user i and K is the total number of users in the system, it yields a good balance between system efficiency and fairness. Based on Kelly's theory, many in-depth researches were carried out in the past decade (4-7). However, based on the survey on classical utility theory, we find out another utility function, which is more suitable for resource allocation, especially in multimedia traffic condition. That is negative exponential utility function, which is called Customer Satisfaction (CS) utility in this paper. Compared with the PF utility, it is proved that the CS utility achieves higher resource efficiency under the condition of relative inadequate resources, while achieves better fairness under the condition of relative adequate resources. The turning point of efficiency and fairness is figured out, which is determined by Customer Satisfaction factor (CSF). Based on the CS utility, the CS resource allocation strategy, namely CS strategy, is carried out. Through flexible design of the CSF according to different service requirements, the CS strategy performs better than the PF strategy in both real time (RT) and best effort (BE) traffic. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II gives the concept of CS. Based on Pratt's research on risk aversion in 1964 (8), we compare the constant risk aversion and decreasing risk aversion utility functions, and figure out the meaning of risk aversion in resource allocation in Sections III. Section IV proposes the CS utility, and describes the CS resource allocation strategy. Then we compare the CS strategy with the PF strategy in both real time (RT) and best effort (BF) traffic in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.\n",

            "Abstract: This study is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the large scale LAI inversion algorithms using red and near-infrared reflectance obtained from high resolution satellite imagery. The algorithms are developed based on the principle commonly used for ground-based optical determination of LAI by assuming that high resolution remote sensing imagery is capable to distinguish shadows/gaps from canopy. Gap fraction was obtained from scaled difference of Normalized difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Scaled Difference Vegetation Index (SDVI), and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) from SPOT 10 m pixel imagery. The sensitivity of the methodology was evaluated for spatial resolution effects, effectiveness test with ground-based measurement, simulated spectral data and MODIS LAI product.

            "Abstract: A system for measuring time-variant impulse responses and a database of such measurements for the aeronautical voice channel are presented. Maximum length sequences (MLS) are transmitted over the voice channel with a standard aeronautical radio and the received signals are recorded. For the purpose of synchronisation, both the transmitted and received signals are recorded in parallel with a GPS-based timing signal. The flight path of the aircraft is accurately tracked. A collection of recordings of MLS transmissions is generated during flights with a general aviation aircraft. The measurements cover a wide range of typical flight situations as well as static back-to-back calibrations. The resulting database is made available under a public licence free of charge. The estimated time-variant impulse responses provide a characterisation of the aeronautical voice channel. This characterisation is needed for improvements and add-ons to voice communication systems as in air traffic control, where the analogue radio will remain in use for many years to come.\n",

            "Abstract: Decisions about the release date need to balance between the degree of readiness (quality) of the product and the potential competitive advantage and added value of (early) delivery. Based on an existing optimization approach for solving the maximum value release planning problem for a fixed release time, we provide a re-optimization approach for which includes local and global re-planning exchange operations to determine the outcome of varying the release dates. The proposed method determines a set of trade-off solutions related to (i) the value of the features implemented, (ii) their estimated quality, and (iii) the release time. The approach is evaluated by a real-world case study taken from an ongoing project which is to develop the new main release 2.0 for the release planning decision support platform ReleasePlanner™ v1.6.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents kernel regularization information criterion (KRIC), which is a new criterion for tuning regularization parameters in kernel logistic regression (KLR) and support vector machines (SVMs). The main idea of the KRIC is based on the regularization information criterion (RIC). We derive an eigenvalue equation to calculate the KRIC and solve the problem. The computational cost for parameter tuning by the KRIC is reduced drastically by using the Nystroumlm approximation. The test error rate of SVMs or KLR with the regularization parameter tuned by the KRIC is comparable with the one by the cross validation or evaluation of the evidence. The computational cost of the KRIC is significantly lower than the one of the other criteria\n",

            "Abstract: This paper describes a digital system designed for the automatic detection and measurement of the velocity of moving objects in images acquired by means of a common TV-camera mounted onto a microscope. The main characteristics of this system are the following: 1) it can perform a realtime gray level difference between two successive frames in order to detect moving objects and to suppress stationary objects (subtraction procedure); usually the delay between two successive frames varies linearly from 40 msec to 1920 msec; 2) it reduces the size of images resulting from the subtraction procedure (difference images) and stores them in the frame memory; the result of these operation, all performed in real-time, is a film of time sequences; 3) it performs an automatic labelization in order to recognize the moving microorganisms and to calculate their area in each difference image; 4) it calculates and plots the variation of the average area of the cells moving in the microscope field; 5) it completes the analysis in few seconds.\n",

            "Abstract: The work paradigm of crowd sourcing holds huge potential for organizations by providing access to a large workforce. However, an increase of crowd work entails increasing effort to evaluate the quality of the submissions. As evaluations by experts are inefficient, time-consuming, expensive, and are not guaranteed to be effective, our paper presents a concept for an automated classification process for crowd work. Using the example of crowd generated patent transcripts we build on interdisciplinary research to present an approach to classifying them along two dimensions - correctness and readability. To achieve this, we identify and select text attributes from different disciplines as input for machine-learning classification algorithms and evaluate the suitability of three well regarded algorithms, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. Key findings are that the proposed classification approach is feasible and the SVM classifier performs best in our experiment.\n",

            "Abstract: Ethernet's high performance, low cost and ubiquity have made it the dominant networking technology for many application domains. Unfortunately, its distributed forwarding topology computation protocol - the Rapid Spanning Tree Proto- col (RSTP) - can suffer from a classic \"count-to-infinity\" problem that may lead to a forwarding loop under certain network failures. The consequences are serious. During the period of \"count-to-infinity\", which can last tens of seconds even in a small network, the network can become highly congested by packets that persist in cycles in the network, even packet forwarding can fail as the forwarding tables are polluted. In this paper, we explain the origin of this problem in detail and study its behavior. We find that simply tuning RSTP's parameter settings cannot adequately address the fundamental problem with \"count-to- infinity\". We propose a simple and effective solution called RSTP with Epochs. This approach uses epochs of sequence numbers in protocol messages to eliminate stale protocol information in the network and allows the forwarding topology to recover in merely one round-trip time across the network.\n",

            "Abstract: An amplify-and-forward, multi-branch, multi-hop relay system with K relays, in which the relays broadcast to other relays as well as the destination, is analyzed. An approximate symbol-error-rate (SER) expression, which is valid for any number of relays and for several modulation schemes, is found for the multi-hop system. Also, the cumulative density function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) are found for the random variable, Z = XY/(X + Y + c), where X and Y are sums of independent, Erlang random variables, and c is a constant. The moment generating function (MGF) of Z is found for the special case in which c = 0. It is shown that these results are generalizations of previously published results for special cases of Z. The MGF of Z is used to develop the approximate SER expression. Results for the analytic SER expression are included and compared with simulation results for various values of K, for various modulation schemes, and for two choices of system parameters (channel variances). Results for the multi-hop system are also compared to results for the two-hop system (in which relays transmit only to the destination).\n",

In the field of physiological monitoring, there are several goals that ambient intelligence can help us achieve. First, when patients are anxious, unobtrusive monitoring does not aggravate their anxiety. Second, when patients are at risk and there are insufficient caregivers to attend to each patient individually in a timely manner, unobtrusive pervasive monitoring can reassure patients that they are being cared for. Furthermore, caregivers appreciate being able to monitor more patients. The SMART system was developed to monitor patients' vital signs and locations in the waiting area of a hospital's emergency department. This paper reviews the SMART system and compares it to several other systems in related areas.\n",

The aim is to discuss and compare two approaches to Future Networks (FN) and services: the evolution of NGN, and the revolutionary approach of a new FGI. We present both frameworks from the services point of view as they are delivered to the end-user, as well as from the architectural point of view. We compare selected properties of both approaches to explain commonalities and differences. Their challenges are similar: managing the quality of experience, mobility, security, scalability and providing openness to applications. Based on this comparison, we evaluate possible areas for future convergence in the approach of the two architectures to the Future Network concept. Our analysis shows that despite their different backgrounds, the internet’s FGI and telco’s NGN are not that different after all. The convergence of the two approaches therefore seems the only logical way forward.\n",

            "Abstract: The proliferation of electronic document formats impedes the dissemination and management of documents. Indeed, a common format with structural information is required to obtain document indexing and navigation. While in some formats it is easy to decode and preserve the document structure information, often the only easily obtainable representation is Postscript, where only the geometrical information remains. Even if an organization is willing to convert all its document producing activities to a structure preserving format such as HTML, the existing documents need to be converted. The paper addresses the difficult problem of extracting the structure of a document from a geometrical representation. An interactive tool to extract the document content and structure from a geometric representation (Postscript) has been developed. It successfully analyzes several documents produced with different tools, and produces structural information using the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). The end user, when presented with the extracted document structure, can interactively modify it, if needed. The tool is easily extended to recognize new constructs and is aimed at organizations needing to convert numerous documents for searching and browsing on intranets or on the Internet.\n",

The segmentation is done in three steps: 1) preliminary segmentation to hypothesize speaker turning points; 2) clustering of segments; and 3) re-segmentation to determine speaker identity of each segment. It is found that vocal source related features are more speaker-discriminative than the conventional vocal tract related features for small amount of data. This motivates us to thoughtfully incorporate vocal source features into early stages of the speaker segmentation process, where decisions have to be made with limited data. Speaker segmentation experiments are carried out on 36 summed channel conversations in the NIST 2004 Speaker Recognition Evaluation. The proposed use of vocal source features leads to noticeable performance improvement.\n",

In this paper, we consider RkNN query processing in the case where the distances between attribute values are not necessarily metric. Dissimilarities between objects could then be a monotonic aggregate of dissimilarities between their values, such aggregation functions being specified at query time. We outline real world cases that motivate RkNN processing in such scenarios. We consider the AL-Tree index and its applicability in RkNN query processing. We develop an approach that exploits the group level reasoning enabled by the AL-Tree in RkNN processing. We evaluate our approach against a Naive approach that performs sequential scans on contiguous data and an improved block-based approach that we provide. We use real-world datasets and synthetic data with varying characteristics for our experiments. This extensive empirical evaluation shows that our approach is better than existing methods in terms of computational and disk access costs, leading to significantly better response times.\n",

Some approximation mechanisms have been proposed to be applied for a large-scale auction problem regardless of its computational intractability. Although theoretically such mechanisms could be applied for dynamic electricity auctions, there is little empirical analysis about how such a fast approximation mechanism can be applied to the actual electric power allocation problem when we consider the situation that there are sustainable electric power sources and the consumers have preferences for them. In this paper, we present a preliminary analysis about applying a fast approximation mechanism for multi-unit combinatorial auctions to an electric power allocation problem when it includes sustainable power sources.

            "Abstract: A VCO frequency calibration technique suitable for a wideband fractional-N PLL is presented. It provides a fast and high-precision search for an optimal discrete tuning curve of an LC VCO during the coarse tuning process in a fractional-N PLL. A high-speed frequency error detector (FED) converts the VCO frequency to a digital value and computes the exact frequency difference from a target frequency. A minimum error code finder finds an optimal code that is closest to the target frequency. Due to the pure digital domain operation, a ΔΣ modulator in PLL can be deactivated during the calibration process, which makes this technique fast and accurate especially for a ΔΣ fractional-N PLL. We achieve a single-bit calibration time of only kT REF  for obtaining a frequency resolution of f REF /k, and compared to the conventional techniques, which is the best performance in terms of the calibration time versus resolution. Such fast VCO frequency calibration can greatly reduce the total lock time in a PLL. A 2.3-3.9 GHz fractional-N PLL employing the proposed calibration technique is implemented in 0.13 μm CMOS. Successful operation is verified through experimental results. The measured calibration time for a 6-bit capbank is 1.09 and 2.03 μs for a frequency resolution of 19.2 and 4.8 MHz, respectively.\n",

In order to continue this development of a clinically applicable Doppler equipment, we need to determine different dimensions of the paranasal sinuses, especially the thickness of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus (at the canine fossa). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the thickness of the canine fossa. This study aimed to (a) estimate different dimensions of the maxillary and frontal sinuses measured on computed tomography (CT) of the head, (b) define cut-off values for the normal upper and lower limits of the different measured structures, (c) determine differences in age, side and gender, (d) compare manually and automatically estimated maxillary sinuses volumes, and (e) present incidental findings in the paranasal sinuses among the study patients. Methods: Dimensions of 120 maxillary and frontal sinuses from head CTs were measured independently by two radiologists. Results: The mean value of the maxillary sinus volume was 15.7 ± 5.3 cm 3 and significantly larger in males than in females (P = 0.004). There was no statistically significant correlation between the volume of maxillary sinuses with age or side. The mean value of the bone thickness at the canine fossa was 1.1 ± 0.4 mm. The automatically estimated volume of the maxillary sinuses was 14-17% higher than the calculated volume. There was high interobserver agreement with regard to the different measurements performed in this study. Different types of incidental findings of the paranasal sinuses were found in 35% of the patients. Conclusion: We presented different dimensions of the maxillary and frontal sinuses on CTs. We believe that our data are necessary for further development of a clinically applicable Doppler equipment for staging rhinosinusitis.\n",

This conditioning may allow users to avoid recognition errors in an intuitive way, by adding extra, possibly redundant description. This paper evaluates the effect on error reduction of redundant descriptions in an interactive semantic language model. In order to evaluate the effect in natural use, the model is run on rich domains, supporting references to sets of individuals (instead of just individuals themselves) arranged in multiple continuous dimensions (a 2-D floorplan scene). Results of these experiments suggest that an interactive semantic language model allows users to achieve significantly higher recognition accuracy by providing additional redundant spoken description.\n",

In this paper, a sound approach for a Twin Rotor Multi-input Multi-Output System (TRMS) parametric modeling is proposed based on dynamic spread factor particle swarm optimization. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is demonstrated as an efficient global search method for nonlinear complex systems without any a priory knowledge of the system structure. The proposed method formulates a modified inertia weight algorithm by using a dynamic spread factor (SF). The inertia weight plays an important role in terms of balancing both the global and local search. Thus, the usage of dynamic SF is proved experimentally to satisfy main issues of using basic PSO that are trapped in local optima and preservation of diversity. Results in both time and frequency domains portray a very good parametric model that mimic well the behavior of a TRMS. Validation tests clearly show the effectiveness of the algorithm considered in this work.\n",

            "Abstract: We present an algorithm for the real-time detection and interpretation of pointing gestures, performed with one or both arms. The pointing gestures are used as an intuitive tracking interface for a user interacting with an immersive virtual environment. We have defined the pointing direction to correspond to the line of sight connecting the eyes and the pointing fingertip. If a pointing gesture is being performed, the algorithm detects and tracks the position of the user's eyes and fingertip and computes the origin and direction of that gesture with respect to a real-world coordinate system. The algorithm is based on the body silhouettes extracted from multiple views and uses point correspondences to reconstruct in 3D the points of interest. The system doesn't require initial poses, special clothing, or markers.\n",

            "Abstract: In recent years, integrating high-level synthesis and physical design has become essential for successful timing closure. In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic approach to perform integrated datapath allocation and floorplanning. In contrast to existing methodologies that tradeoff high-level design space searched with accuracy of physical estimates, the proposed methodology performs exhaustive high-level synthesis (datapath allocation) with heuristic floorplanning. Exhaustive search guarantees optimal allocation results. Heuristic floorplanning imparts flexibility to update the floorplan while constructing the allocation solution. This improves accuracy of the floorplan estimates used. To tackle the increased design space, we propose novel probabilistic-gain measures that predict the impact of an allocation decision on the constraints, prior to the allocation decision being made. The probabilistic-gain measures are used to select allocation decisions that will most likely lead to optimal solutions early, thereby minimizing time-consuming floorplan evaluations of decisions that will most likely lead to sub-optimal solutions. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n",

In the present investigation, the traditional Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) technique has been combined, which is used for analysis of fibers of large length, with frequency analysis of the time domain signal to develop a system that detects faults in optical IC's or fibers of very small lengths in a non-destructive fashion. The drawback of the OTDR is that it can be used only for cables of long distances because when used in short fibers the total time taken between the injected laser beam and the response will be negligible. To circumvent this problem we use the frequency domain analysis of the time domain data by applying Fourier transform.\n",

By leading on analytical formulations and on experimental evaluations, we show the advantages and limits of each scheme in term of statistical undetectability and capacity in the case of active warden.

These activities, however, are considered not to be learned completely anew in each individual, but also to have been acquired over the long evolutionary history of human beings. The universal grammar is assumed to be a comprehensive knowledge of grammar that was acquired and hardwired in the brain during human evolution. By employing neuroevolution, we illustrate how the universal grammar might have evolved in the neural network using a genetic algorithm.\n",

The architecture of the system which employs a digitally-controlled switching converter is compared with the state of the art, then fully investigated, together with the methodology used in its design. The performance of the system is described by presenting and discussing the experimental results of laboratory tests.

Fault handling is critical to achieve high reliability for these applications. However, the existing service composition methods seldom consider services’ fault handling, which results in high risk of runtime failure. This paper proposes a formal aspect-oriented approach to designing and analyzing fault of service composition. The underlying formalism is Petri net and its corresponding modeling method. The fault handling process is encapsulated into aspect net and base net, and Petri net is used to model the core concerns and crosscutting concerns, the weaving mechanism systematically integrates these schemas into a complete service composition model. Based on the model, the related theories of Petri net help prove the correctness of fault handling. Finally, an Export Service and simulation results show that our method can ensure the high reliability and design quantity of service composition.\n",

            "Abstract: A novel fuzzy neural network (FNN) quadratic stabilization output feedback control scheme is proposed for the trajectory tracking problems of biped robots with an FNN nonlinear observer. First, a robust quadratic stabilization FNN nonlinear observer is presented to estimate the joint velocities of a biped robot, in which an H/sub /spl infin// approach and variable structure control (VSC) are embedded to attenuate the effect of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. After the construction of the FNN nonlinear observer, a quadratic stabilization FNN controller is developed with a robust hybrid control scheme. As the employment of a quadratic stability approach, not only does it afford the possibility of trading off the design between FNN, H/sub /spl infin// optimal control, and VSC, but conservative estimation of the FNN reconstruction error bound is also avoided by considering the system matrix uncertainty separately. It is shown that all signals in the closed-loop control system are bounded.\n",

The objective function to be minimized is Σ  e∈E W e (i e ) , where  i e   is the number of times edge  e  appears in the solution and  W e (i e ) = i e w p (e, i e )  is the aggregate cost of using edge  e i e   times. For the case when  W e   is weakly convex, which should have wide application in congestion problems, we present a polynomial time algorithm; the algorithm's complexity is quadratic in  k . We also present two heuristics with complexity linear in  k . In an experimental study we show that these heuristics are much faster than the exact algorithm also in practice. These experiments present a diverse combination of input families (four), varying  k  (up to 1000), and penalty functions (two). In most inputs tested the solutions given by the heuristics were within 1% of optimal or much better, especially for large  k . The worst quality observed was 3.2% of optimal.\n",

The system observes a human performing the task, recognizes the human grasp, and maps it onto the manipulator. This paper describes how an observed human grasp can be mapped to that of a given general-purpose manipulator for task replication. Planning the manipulator grasp based upon the observed human grasp is done at two levels: the functional and physical levels. Initially, at the functional level, grasp mapping is achieved at the virtual finger level; the virtual finger is a group of fingers acting against an object surface in a similar manner. Subsequently, at the physical level, the geometric properties of the object and manipulator are considered in fine-tuning the manipulator grasp. Our work concentrates on power or enveloping grasps and the fingertip precision grasps. We conclude by showing an example of an entire programming cycle from human demonstration to robot execution.\n",

            "Abstract: Timely imaging examinations are critical for stroke patients due to the potential life threat. We have proposed a contract-based Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reservation process [1] in order to reduce their waiting time for MRI examinations. Contracted time slots (CTS) are especially reserved for Neural Vascular Department (NVD) treating stroke patients. Patients either wait in a CTS queue for such time slots or are directed to Regular Time Slot (RTS) reservation. This strategy creates “unlucky” patients having to wait for lengthy RTS reservation. This paper proposes and analyzes other contract implementation strategies called RTS reservation strategies. These strategies reserve RTS for NVD but do not direct patients to regular reservations. Patients all wait in the same queue and are served by either CTS or RTS on a FIFO (First In First Out) basis. We prove that RTS reservation strategies are able to reduce the unused time slots and patient waiting time. Extensive numerical results are presented to show the benefits of RTS reservation and to compare various RTS reservation strategies.\n",

            "Abstract: Proposes a method to autonomously select stable visual landmarks from observed features by stereo vision and a given 2D obstacle map. The robot selects as stable landmarks vertical line segments which are distinct and on a vertical plane, because they are expected to be observed reliably from various viewpoints. Due to the vision and motion error of the robot, the observed feature positions include uncertainty. This uncertainty can be reduced by matching the detected vertical plane which includes the features to a known plane in the map. The position of a selected feature is modeled by a probabilistic distribution on the known plane. The selection and modeling process is performed online to adapt to an actual lighting and background condition which varies depending on viewpoints. When the robot moves, it uses several, less uncertain landmarks to estimate its motion. Experimental results in real scenes show the validity of the proposed method.\n",

            "Abstract: Today, there are two major paradigms for vision-based autonomous driving systems: mediated perception approaches that parse an entire scene to make a driving decision, and behavior reflex approaches that directly map an input image to a driving action by a regressor. In this paper, we propose a third paradigm: a direct perception approach to estimate the affordance for driving. We propose to map an input image to a small number of key perception indicators that directly relate to the affordance of a road/traffic state for driving. Our representation provides a set of compact yet complete descriptions of the scene to enable a simple controller to drive autonomously. Falling in between the two extremes of mediated perception and behavior reflex, we argue that our direct perception representation provides the right level of abstraction. To demonstrate this, we train a deep Convolutional Neural Network using recording from 12 hours of human driving in a video game and show that our model can work well to drive a car in a very diverse set of virtual environments. We also train a model for car distance estimation on the KITTI dataset. Results show that our direct perception approach can generalize well to real driving images.

            "Abstract: Regular (tree) model checking (RMC) is a promising generic method for formal verification of infinite-state systems. It encodes configurations of systems as words or trees over a suitable alphabet, possibly infinite sets of configurations as finite word or tree automata, and operations of the systems being examined as finite word or tree transducers. The reachability set is then computed by a repeated application of the transducers on the automata representing the currently known set of reachable configurations. In order to facilitate termination of RMC, various acceleration schemas have been proposed. One of them is a combination of RMC with the abstract-check-refine paradigm yielding the so-called abstract regular model checking (ARMC). ARMC has originally been proposed for word automata and transducers only and thus for dealing with systems with linear (or easily linearisable) structure. In this paper, we propose a generalisation of ARMC to the case of dealing with trees which arise naturally in a lot of modelling and verification contexts. In particular, we first propose abstractions of tree automata based on collapsing their states having an equal language of trees up to some bounded height. Then, we propose an abstraction based on collapsing states having a non-empty intersection (and thus ''satisfying'') the same bottom-up tree ''predicate'' languages. Finally, we show on several examples that the methods we propose give us very encouraging verification results.\n",

            "Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems hold the potential to be an enabling technology for 5G cellular. Uniform planar array (UPA) antenna structures are a focus of much commercial discussion because of their ability to enable a large number of antennas in a relatively small area. With UPA antenna structures, the base station can control the beam direction in both the horizontal and vertical domains simultaneously. However, channel conditions may dictate that one dimension requires higher channel state information (CSI) accuracy than the other. We propose the use of an additional one bit of feedback information sent from the user to the base station to indicate the preferred domain on top of the feedback overhead of CSI quantization in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems. Combined with variable-rate CSI quantization schemes, the numerical studies show that the additional one bit of feedback can increase the quality of CSI significantly for UPA antenna structures.\n",

            "Abstract: There has been extensive research on goodness-of-fit procedures for testing whether or not a sample comes from a specified distribution. These goodness-of-fit tests range from graphical techniques, to tests which exploit characterization results for the specified underlying model. In this article, we propose a goodness-of-fit test for the location-scale family based on progressively Type-II censored data. The test statistic is based on sample spacings, and generalizes a test procedure proposed by Tiku . The null distribution of the test statistic is shown to be approximated closely by a s-normal distribution. However, in certain situations it would be better to use simulated critical values instead of the s-normal approximation. We examine the performance of this test for the s-normal and extreme-value (Gumbel) models against different alternatives through Monte Carlo simulations. We also discuss two methods of power approximation based on s-normality, and compare the results with those obtained by simulation. Results of the simulation study for a wide range of sample sizes, censoring schemes, and different alternatives reveal that the proposed test has good power properties in detecting departures from the s-normal and Gumbel distributions. Finally, we illustrate the method proposed here using real data from a life-testing experiment. It is important to mention here that this test can be extended to multi-sample situations in a manner similar to that of Balakrishnan et al.\n",

            "Abstract: The visual system is sensitive to symmetries in the frontoparallel plane, and bilateral symmetry about a vertical axis has a particular salience. However, these symmetries represent only a subset of the symmetries realizable in three-dimensional space. The retinal image symmetries formed when viewing natural objects are typically the projections of three-dimensional objects—animals, for example—that have a symmetry in depth. To characterize human sensitivity to depth symmetry, experiments measured observers’ ability to discriminate stereo displays that were symmetrically distributed in depth and those that were asymmetrically distributed. Disparity values were distributed about one of four planes passing through the z-axis and differing in frontoparallel orientation. Asymmetrical patterns were generated by perturbing one of these disparities. Symmetrical-asymmetrical discrimination thresholds were lowest for symmetry about the vertical plane and highest for the horizontal plane. Thresholds for discriminating repetitions and non-repetitions of depth values did not differ across the four planes, whereas discriminations for depth gradients differed from both the symmetry and repetition cases. The heightened sensitivity to symmetry in depth about the vertical plane is a 3-D analog of 2-D mirror-image symmetry performance and could be its source.\n",

We show the benefit of moving error correcting coding to higher levels in the data transmission protocol stack. The data is delivered using a data carousel and the FEC code utilized is a hyper-Tornado code for which the main characteristics are long codewords and near linear complexity. Because the hyper-Tornado code provides internal data interleaving and supports long code lengths, we can observe a significantly decreased number of mean data carousel iterations before an error-free carousel object is received compared to the basic DVB-H system. This reduction is for the user observed as decreased download-time, but also provides energy saving in the receiver due to shorter receiver on-times.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper proposes a high performance control in a d-q reference frame for a single-phase grid connected converter. The proposed control allows to obtain easily an infinite control loop gain at fundamental frequency and a superior disturbance rejection: this assures only active current injection thus maximum conversion efficiency and decreases current distortion. The control has been implemented in a single-stage converter for single-phase PV systems. The converter is a standard full-bridge three-level voltage source inverter that delivers a sinusoidal current to the grid through an inductive filter and a line frequency isolation transformer. The transformer blocks out the DC components injected in the grid but the current feedback, closed around the output of the transformer, can lead to core saturation. To avoid saturation a compensation strategy has been developed relying on output current distortion in correspondence of voltage zero crossings. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control architecture and of the strategy adopted to avoid transformer core saturation.\n",

            "Abstract: Background: Cheminformaticians have to routinely process and analyse libraries of small molecules. Among other things, that includes the standardization of molecules, calculation of various descriptors, visualisation of molecular structures, and downstream analysis. For this purpose, scientific workflow platforms such as the Konstanz Information Miner can be used if provided with the right plug-in. A workflow-based cheminformatics tool provides the advantage of ease-of-use and interoperability between complementary cheminformatics packages within the same framework, hence facilitating the analysis process. Results: KNIME-CDK comprises functions for molecule conversion to/from common formats, generation of signatures, fingerprints, and molecular properties. It is based on the Chemistry Development Toolkit and uses the Chemical Markup Language for persistence. A comparison with the cheminformatics plug-in RDKit shows that KNIME-CDK supports a similar range of chemical classes and adds new functionality to the framework. We describe the design and integration of the plug-in, and demonstrate the usage of the nodes on ChEBI, a library of small molecules of biological interest. Conclusions: KNIME-CDK is an open-source plug-in for the Konstanz Information Miner, a free workflow platform. KNIME-CDK is build on top of the open-source Chemistry Development Toolkit and allows for efficient cross-vendor structural cheminformatics. Its ease-of-use and modularity enables researchers to automate routine tasks and data analysis, bringing complimentary cheminformatics functionality to the workflow environment.\n",

            "Abstract: Methods are investigated for reducing events in sequential circuit fault simulation by reducing the number of faults simulated for each test vector. Inactive faults, which are guaranteed to have no effect on the output or the next state, are identified using local information from the fault-free circuit in one technique. In a second technique, the Star-algorithm is extended to handle sequential circuits and provides global information about inactive faults, based on the fault-free circuit state. Both techniques are integrated into the PROOFS synchronous sequential circuit fault simulator. An average 28% reduction in faulty circuit gate evaluations is obtained for the 19 ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits studied using the first technique, and 33% reduction for the two techniques combined. Execution times decrease by an average of 17% when the first technique is used. For the largest circuits, further improvements in execution time are made when the Star-algorithm is included. >\n",

We propose to use these interdependencies to quantify the quality of subgroups, by integrating Bayesian networks with the Exceptional Model Mining framework. Within this framework, candidate subgroups are generated. For each candidate, we fit a Bayesian network on the target variables. Then we compare the network’s structure to the structure of the Bayesian network fitted on the whole dataset. To perform this comparison, we define an edit distance-based distance metric that is appropriate for Bayesian networks. We show interesting subgroups that we experimentally found with our method on datasets from music theory, semantic scene classification, biology and zoogeography.\n",

Model uncertainties including steady state error and unmodelled dynamics are considered as additional disturbance inputs and the observer is designed in order that the error dynamics is input-to-state stable. Lookup tables, which are widely used to represent complex nonlinear characteristics of engine systems, appear in their original form in the designed reduced-order observer. The designed pressure observer is tested on an AMESim powertrain simulation model. Comparing with the sliding mode method, the designed pressure observer has the better performance.\n",

            "Abstract: We present a statistically principled sinogram smoothing approach for X-ray computed tomography (CT) with the intent of reducing noise-induced streak artifacts. These artifacts arise in CT when some subset of the transmission measurements capture relatively few photons because of high attenuation along the measurement lines. Attempts to reduce these artifacts have focused on the use of adaptive filters that strive to tailor the degree of smoothing to the local noise levels in the measurements. While these approaches involve loose consideration of the measurement statistics to determine smoothing levels, they do not explicitly model the statistical distributions of the measurement data. We present an explicitly statistical approach to sinogram smoothing in the presence of photon-starved measurements. It is an extension of a nonparametric sinogram smoothing approach using penalized Poisson-likelihood functions that we have previously developed for emission tomography. Because the approach explicitly models the data statistics, it is naturally adaptive-it will smooth more variable measurements more heavily than it does less variable measurements. We find that it significantly reduces streak artifacts and noise levels without comprising image resolution.\n",

            "Abstract: In this work, we utilize a recently studied more accurate range noise model for 3D sensors to derive from scratch the expressions for the optimum plane which best fits a point-cloud and for the combined covariance matrix of the plane's parameters. The parameters in question are the plane's normal and its distance to the origin. The range standard-deviation model used by us is a quadratic function of the true range and is a function of the incidence angle as well. We show that for this model, the maximum-likelihood plane is biased, whereas the least-squares plane is not. The plane-parameters' covariance matrix for the least-squares plane is shown to possess a number of desirable properties, e.g., the optimal solution forms its null-space and its components are functions of easily understood terms like the planar-patch's center and scatter.We verify our covariance expression with that obtained by the eigenvector perturbation method. We further compare our method to that of renormalization with respect to the theoretically best covariance matrix in simulation. The application of our approach to real-time range-image registration and plane fusion is shown by an example using a commercially available 3D range sensor. Results show that our method has good accuracy, is fast to compute, and is easy to interpret intuitively.\n",

            "Abstract: Spatial aggregation is an important class of queries for geoaware spatial sensor database applications. Given a set of spatial regions, it involves the aggregation of dynamic sensor readings over each of these regions simultaneously. Nested spatial aggregation involves one more level of aggregation, combining these aggregates into a single aggregate value. We show that spatial aggregate values can often be computed in-network, rather than waiting until the partial aggregate records reach the root as is now the case. This decreases the amount of communication involved in query evaluation, thereby reducing the network's power consumption. We describe an algorithm that allows us to determine when an aggregate record for any spatial region is ready to be evaluated in-network, based on decorating the routing tree with region leader lists. We also identify several important scenarios, such as nested spatial aggregation and filtering predicates, when the savings from our approach are expected to be particularly great.\n",

Due to the poor scalability of SVM (cubic in the number of training points) and the massive size of fMRI images, a SVM analysis is usually performed after data collection. Recent advances in real-time fMRI applications, such as Brain Computer Interfaces, require a fast and reliable classification method running in synchronization with the image collection. We design an online Kernel SVM (OKSVM) algorithm based on the Sequential Minimization Optimization (SMO) method, that is fast (training on each new image within 1 sec), has memory and time cost that scales linearly with the number of points used, and yields comparable prediction performance to an off-line SVM.We analyze the method's performance by testing it on real fMRI data sets, and show that OKSVM performs well at greatly reduced computational cost. Our work provides a feasible online Kernel SVM for real-time fMRI experiments, and can be used to guide for the design of similar online classifiers in fMRI cognitive state classification.\n",

It emphasizes on detailed classification of the entire wide range of pedestrian actions in the context of road crossing and their recognition from a viewpoint of a static car in the traffic signal. For this purpose, we develop a new pedestrian action dataset containing 160 videos of eight actions with twenty subjects per action. First, action sequences are converted into Motion History Image where silhouette sequence is condensed into gray scale images, while dominant motion information is preserved. Then, Histogram of Oriented Gradient of the Motion History Image is calculated from local appearance and shape within the image for feature extraction. Finally, Support Vector Machine is employed for pedestrian action classification. The demonstrated method successfully classified 91 % of the pedestrian action.

            "Abstract: This paper studies a monopolist firm selling a fixed capacity. The firm sets a price before demand uncertainty is resolved. Speculators may enter the market purely with the intention of resale, which can be profitable if demand turns out to be high. Consumers may strategically choose when to purchase, and they may also choose to purchase from the firm or from the speculators. We characterize equilibrium prices and profits and analyze the long-run capacity decisions of the firm. There are three major findings. First, the presence of speculators increases the firm's expected profits even though the resale market competes with the firm. Second, by facilitating resale, the firm can mimic dynamic pricing outcomes and enjoy the associated benefits while charging a fixed price. Third, speculative behavior may generate incentives for the seller to artificially restrict supply, and thus may lead to lower capacity investments. We also explore several model extensions that highlight the robustness of our results.\n",

            "Abstract: Noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery translate brain activity into motor execution commands to control external devices. They have largely relied on the measurement of the sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) and the beta rhythms in electroencephalography (EEG). However, most BCIs of this type have exploited SMR and beta rhythms observed from a few EEG channels over the sensorimotor area. They also extracted movement-related information from each channel independently, without considering connectivity between channels. In this study, we aim to investigate whether we can obtain useful information of movements from the connectivity measures across a wide range of EEG channels, over the whole brain. To address this question, we evaluated a simple connectivity measure - cross-correlation coefficients (CCs) - for twenty-two EEG channels distributed over different brain regions to differentiate four different motor imagery states, including left hand, right hand, both feet, and tongue. The tem oral variations of CCs across twenty-two channels exhibited distinct patterns as to four motor imagery states. It suggests that we may use connectivity as a useful source to derive noninvasive BCIs.\n",

We then incorporate into the diagnoser three tree transformations that prune the tree before it is searched. These transformations make use of two kinds of assertion about the correctness of the program and maintain the soundness and completeness of the diagnoser.

In principle, virtualization involves the use of an encapsulating software layer (Hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor) which surrounds or underlies an operating system and provides the same inputs, outputs, and behavior that would be expected from an actual physical device. This abstraction means that an ideal Virtual Machine Monitor provides an environment to the software equivalent to the host system, but which is decoupled from the hardware state. Because a virtual machine is not dependent on the state of the physical hardware, multiple virtual machines may be installed on a single set of hardware. The decoupling of physical and logical states gives virtualization inherent security benefits. However, the design, implementation, and deployment of virtualization technology have also opened up novel threats and security issues which, while not particular to system virtualization, take on new forms in relation to it. Reverse engineering becomes easier due to introspection capabilities, as encryption keys, security algorithms, low-level protection, intrusion detection, or antidebugging measures can become more easily compromised. Furthermore, associated technologies such as virtual routing and networking can create challenging issues for security, intrusion control, and associated forensic processes. We explain the security considerations and some associated methodologies by which security breaches can occur, and offer recommendations for how virtualized environments can best be protected. Finally, we offer a set of generalized recommendations that can be applied to achieve secure virtualized implementations.\n",

Most previous work in this field relies on the diagonal covariance assumption in modeling speaker specific characteristics via Gaussian mixture models. This paper proposes the use of full covariance models that can capture linear correlations among feature components. This is of importance for missing data marginalization techniques as they depend on spectral rather than cepstral feature representations. Bounded and complete marginalization schemes are investigated both with diagonal and full covariance mixture models. Speaker identification experiments using stationary and non-stationary noise confirm that full covariance models are indeed superior compared to diagonal models.\n",

Such faults are known to occur in practice. It is increasingly important to consider their detection to meet high quality requirements for circuits fabricated in deep submicrometer technologies. We focus on the detectability of FGT faults by the standard voltage- and current-based production test strategies that we refer to as static voltage (SV), dynamic voltage (DV), and static current (SC) test strategies. We demonstrate how the behavior of the devices caused by FGT faults depends on two classes of technological and topological parameters: the predictable and unpredictable parameters. We show that an FGT fault can induce abnormal logic values, additional delays, or increased power supply current. We introduce the concept of a detectability interval, i.e., the range of values an unpredictable parameter may assume that one allows for the fault detection using a specific test strategy. We illustrate how the detectability intervals for the SV and DV strategies complement that of the SC strategy. In addition, a new test scheme that results in an increased SC detectability of FGT faults is developed. Finally, we demonstrate the effects of initial trapped charges and the effects of coupling to surrounding metal on the detectability intervals of each of the test strategies.\n",

One can view this as a recall problem and address it accordingly. Recall oriented strategies to QA may generate considerable amounts of noise. To combat this, many open domain QA systems contain an explicit filtering or re-ranking component, which often check whether the answer is of the correct semantic type. Particular classes of questions expect specific answer types to which all of their answers should belong. We compare two kinds of strategies for answer type checking for open domain QA. One is redundancy-based and builds on the intuition that the amount of implicit knowledge which connects an answer to a question can be estimated by exploiting the redundancy of information available on the web. The other is knowledge-intensive, and exploits structured and semi-structured data sources to determine, with high confidence, the semantic type of suggested answers.\n",

On the other hand, connection and disconnection occur intermittently in lower layers. Persistent connection is often required by several applications~(e.g., HTTP, large data transfer, etc.). It has to be available continuously till the application closes it explicitly. To realize such a persistent connection, transient link failure has to be masked from the application layer. In this paper, we propose a way to provide persistent connections in TCP using accrual failure detector. Once the connection is established, the session layer can properly handle link failures, for example, it can suspend while link failure or unstable link condition, and resume after the recovery of the link. To realize persistent connections, we first implemented an interrogation-based accrual failure detector and evaluated its performance in several environments. Then, proposed the procedure for persistent connections using the failure detector.\n",

When a control law is formulated in the expanded space, the proposed characterizations provide contractibility conditions for implementation of the control law in the original system. A full freedom is provided for selecting appropriate matrices in the proposed expansion-contraction control scheme. In particular, the derived theoretical framework serves as a flexible environment for expansion-contraction control design of descriptor systems under overlapping information structure constraints.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper we use a novel framework, the Microcanonical Multiscale Formalism (MMF), to analyze speech signals. The MMF is based on the computation of geometrical and local parameters — the singularity exponents — which allow nonlinear analysis of their complex dynamics and, particularly, characterize their intermittent signature. We define an accumulative measure on these exponents which has the nice property of producing clear and distinctive changes at phoneme boundaries. We present preliminary experiments on the TIMIT database, which show that singular exponents convey indeed valuable information about the local dynamics of speech. They also show that the measure we define has a good potential to provide a new and powerful method for text-independent phonetic segmentation.\n",

            "Abstract: Accurate, continuous resource monitoring and profiling are critical for enabling performance tuning and scheduling optimization. In desktop grid systems that employ sandboxing, these issues are challenging because (1) subjobs inside sandboxes are executed in a virtual computing environment and (2) the state of this virtual environment within the sandboxes is reset to an initial empty state after a subjob completion.#R##N##R##N#DGMonitor is a monitoring tool which builds a global, accurate, and continuous view of real resource utilization for desktop grids with sandboxing. Our monitoring tool measures performance unobtrusively and reliably, uses a simple performance data model, and is easy to use. Our measurements demonstrate that DGMonitor can scale to large desktop grids (up to 12000 PCs) with low monitoring overhead in terms of resource consumption (less than 0.1% per machine).#R##N##R##N#Though we originally developed DGMonitor with the Entropia DCGrid platform, our tool is easily portable and integrated into other desktop grid systems. In all of these systems, DGMonitor data can support existing and novel information services, particularly for performance tuning and scheduling. In this paper, the high scalability and monitoring power of DGMonitor are demonstrated with the Entropia DCGrid platform and the BOINC platform respectively.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we present a two-phase design space exploration (DSE) approach to address the problem of real-time application mapping on a flexible MPSoC platform. Our approach is composed of two independent phases - analytical estimation/pruning and system simulation - communicating via a well-defined interface. The strength of the resulting strategy is twofold. On one hand, it is capable of combining the benefits of analytical models and simulation tools (i.e., speed and accuracy). And on the other hand, separating pruning and evaluation phases facilitates the integration of different or additional pruning techniques as well as other existing simulation tools. Finally, we also present several proof-of-concept DSE experiments to illustrate distinct aspects and capabilities of our framework. These experimental results reveal that our approach, compared to other approaches based only on analytical estimation models or simulations guided by e.g. genetic algorithms, not only can explore a large design space and reach a valid solution in a time-efficient way, but also can provide solutions optimizing resource usage efficiency, system traffic and processor load balancing.\n",

            "Abstract: Directed graphical models with one layer of observed random variables and one or more layers of hidden random variables have been the dominant modelling paradigm in many research fields. Although this approach has met with considerable success, the causal semantics of these models can make it difficult to infer the posterior distribution over the hidden variables. In this paper we propose an alternative two-layer model based on exponential family distributions and the semantics of undirected models. Inference in these \"exponential family harmoniums\" is fast while learning is performed by minimizing contrastive divergence. A member of this family is then studied as an alternative probabilistic model for latent semantic indexing. In experiments it is shown that they perform well on document retrieval tasks and provide an elegant solution to searching with keywords.\n",

In this paper, we introduce a set of control mechanisms at different levels of the protocol architecture to be used in MPEG-2-based video communications systems using ATM networks as their underlying transmission mechanism. We argue that in order to be able to create video systems able to cope with some of the errors encountered in computer communications systems, a structured set of error-resilient protocol mechanisms is needed. Our results show the effectiveness of using a structured set of control mechanisms to overcome for the loss of cells carrying VBR MPEG-2 video streams.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper we focus on a linear optimization problem with uncertainties, having expectations in the objective and in the set of constraints. We present a modular framework to obtain an approximate solution to the problem that is distributionally robust and more flexible than the standard technique of using linear rules. Our framework begins by first affinely extending the set of primitive uncertainties to generate new linear decision rules of larger dimensions and is therefore more flexible. Next, we develop new piecewise-linear decision rules that allow a more flexible reformulation of the original problem. The reformulated problem will generally contain terms with expectations on the positive parts of the recourse variables. Finally, we convert the uncertain linear program into a deterministic convex program by constructing distributionally robust bounds on these expectations. These bounds are constructed by first using different pieces of information on the distribution of the underlying uncertainties to develop separate bounds and next integrating them into a combined bound that is better than each of the individual bounds.\n",

            "Abstract: The Himalayan region is characterised by mountain communities that have many of the poorest and isolated peoples in the world. These communities suffer from poor infrastructure and lack of access to basic resources and services, including relevant information. Since the mid-1990s, Internet technologies have been used increasingly in different parts of the Himalayan region, in an attempt to address problems of information access and sharing and of communication among and between communities. The overall objectives of using these technologies in mountain areas have been to bring about an improvement in the quality of life and to seek to avoid increasing marginalisation of mountain communities through a widening information gap between the richer, connected urban populations and the poorer isolated rural communities. There is growing interest on the part of various players, including governments, private organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), to promote the use of the Internet and related information and communication technologies. Among the international NGOs, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) plays a unique role in the Himalayas, as it has a mandate to specifically serve communities in mountain areas and it works throughout the region, in Afghanistan, North Pakistan, North India, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. This paper traces the history of Internet usage in the Himalayas and introduces the issues and problems faced in implementing projects and other initiatives to promote usage. Specific reference is made to examples arising from some of ICIMOD's projects; lessons learned from these experiences are highlighted.\n",

With the advent of ES based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and an increasing demand of IT-supported interorganizational collaboration, implementation projects face paradigmatically new challenges. The configuration of ES is costly and error-prone. Dependencies between business processes and business documents are hardly explicit and foster component proliferation instead of reuse. Configurative modeling can support the problem in two ways: First, conceptual modeling abstracts from technical details and provides more intuitive access and overview. Second, configuration allows the projection of variants from master models providing manageable variants with controlled flexibility. We aim at tackling the problem by proposing an integrated model-based framework for configuring both, processes and business documents, on an equal basis; as together, they constitute the core business components of an ES\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents a new image denoising method based on sparse reconstruction by dictionary learning and collaborative filtering. First, we form an affinity net, in which a node represents an image patch, for the given image by clustering similar patches. For each cluster, we learn an undercomplete dictionary and represent clusters nodes by imposing sparsity inducing norm as a combination of few atoms. Depending on its affinity to other nodes, a single node could be present in multiple clusters making the clusters overlapping. This enables a single global estimation for each filtered pixel to be obtained by collaboratively aggregating its reconstructed patches in the corresponding clusters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance for additive noise removal without requiring the correct noise variance.\n",

            "Abstract: A set of 2 1/2 D primitives, called object wings, are introduced for representation and recognition of arbitrarily shaped 3D objects. There are 34 simple wings. A simple wing is defined as a triple including a pair of surface patches separated by a contour segment. Simple wings can be grouped into composite wings through nonaccidental relationships such as cotermination, symmetry, parallelism, connectivity, colinearity, and curvilinearity. Both simple wings and composite wings, together with their spatial structures, can be used to construct internal models of real-world objects. The configurations of wings possess enough information to be of use for both indexing into models and determining instance pose. Wing definitions and techniques for their detection are presented. Representation in terms of the proposed wing primitives and recognition based on the wing representations are addressed. Experimental results are given to indicate that wing primitives can be stably extracted over a broad change of scale, and that reasonable representations can be constructed. >\n",

            "Abstract: We have developed a wearable device that records the activities of human-human and human-artifact interactions. The device records personal and social everyday-life experiences in multiple modalities such as voice and visible scene, using microphone and camera to imitate human perceptibility. These sensors are used to record the perceived experiences continuously as well as to detect and index interactions from nonverbal behaviors. We employ an infrared LED ID tag system to detect the interactions in terms of the ID and its relative positions of the objects in the visual field of the camera. In this paper, we propose the \"Interaction Scope\" which is defined as the range of relative human/object positions that have a high probability of occurring in conversational interactions. We confirm that the interaction scope exists and can represent the interactions naturally through the analysis of experimental conversational sessions. We also demonstrate that our tag system can be effectively used as a sensor that detects and measures the proposed interaction scope.\n",

We can find a lower order of the higher order differential by choosing higher order differences. It follows that the designers of a block cipher can evaluate the lower bound of the number of chosen plaintexts and the complexity required for the higher order differential attack. We demonstrate an improved higher order Differential attack of a CAST cipher with 5 rounds using chosen higher order differences with fewer chosen plaintexts and less complexity. Concretely, we show that a CAST cipher with 5 rounds is breakable with 216 plaintexts and < 224 times the computation of the round function, which half the values reported in Fast Software Encryption Workshop'98. We also show that it is breakable with 213 plaintexts and about 244 times the computation of the round function, which are 1/16 -th of those reported in Fast Software Encryption Workshop'97.\n",

            "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We propose a methodology for analyzing shared knowledge in engineering design teams. BACKGROUND: Whereas prior work has focused on shared knowledge in small teams at a specific point in time, the model presented here is both scalable and dynamic. METHOD: By quantifying team members' common views of design drivers, we build a network of shared mental models to reveal the structure of shared knowledge at a snapshot in time. Based on a structural comparison of networks at different points in time, a metric of change in shared knowledge is computed. RESULTS: Analysis of survey data from 12 conceptual space mission design sessions reveals a correlation between change in shared knowledge and each of several system attributes, including system development time, system mass, and technological maturity. CONCLUSION: From these results, we conclude that an early period of learning and consensus building could be beneficial to the design of engineered systems. APPLICATION: Although we do not examine team performance directly, we demonstrate that shared knowledge is related to the technical design and thus provide a foundation for improving design products by incorporating the knowledge and thoughts of the engineering design team into the process.

            "Abstract: This paper starts by indicating the analysis of Hempel’s conditions of adequacy for any relation of confirmation (Hempel, 1945) as presented in Huber (submitted). There I argue contra Carnap (1962, Section 87) that Hempel felt the need for two concepts of confirmation: one aiming at plausible theories and another aiming at informative theories. However, he also realized that these two concepts are conflicting, and he gave up the concept of confirmation aiming at informative theories. The main part of the paper consists in working out the claim that one can have Hempel’s cake and eat it too — in the sense that there is a logic of theory assessment that takes into account both of the two conflicting aspects of plausibility and informativeness. According to the semantics of this logic, α is an acceptable theory for evidence β if and only if α is both sufficiently plausible given β and sufficiently informative about β. This is spelt out in terms of ranking functions (Spohn, 1988) and shown to represent the syntactically specified notion of an assessment relation. The paper then compares these acceptability relations to explanatory and confirmatory consequence relations (Flach, 2000) as well as to nonmonotonic consequence relations (Kraus et al., 1990). It concludes by relating the plausibility-informativeness approach to Carnap’s positive relevance account, thereby shedding new light on Carnap’s analysis as well as solving another problem of confirmation theory.\n",

This complexity measure, motivated by the aim of relating the complexity of the functions with the generalization ability that can be obtained when the functions are implemented in feed-forward neural networks, is the sum of a number of components. We concentrate on the case in which we use the first two of these components. The first is related to the \"average sensitivity\" of the function and the second is, in a sense, a measure of the \"randomness\" or lack of structure of the function. In this paper, we investigate the importance of using the second term in the complexity measure, and we consider to what extent these two terms suffice as an indicator of how difficult it is to learn a Boolean function. We also explore the existence of very complex Boolean functions, considering, in particular, the symmetric Boolean functions\n",

            "Abstract: Strong cyclic planning under all state-action pairs has been addressed in the literature. Normally, the more the state-action pairs are, the higher of complexity is. In fact, there are many state-action pairs which are useless for strong cyclic planning. Before finding strong cyclic planning, it is significant to find a set of state-action pairs which are useless for strong cyclic planning, and to best of our knowledge, it is still an open problem. In this paper, hypergraph is defined for a nondeterministic state-transition system, adjacency matrix and reachability matrix of the hypergraph are defined. A method about how to use the adjancey matrix to count the reachability matrix is designed, and a way about how to use the reachability matrix to count the state reachability is presented in a nondeterministic state-transition system. Some important conclusions about strong cyclic planning are obtained by using the state reachability. These conclusions tell us what state-action pairs are useless when we search strong cyclic planning. So a lot of state-action pairs can be eliminated directly from all state-action pairs before searching strong cyclic planning. Our first contribution is the method which finds state reachability in nondeterministic state-transition system. A second contribution is the some important conclusions about strong cyclic planning, these works are significant to improve the efficiency of algorithm for solving strong cyclic planning.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we try to present the problem of epoch detection from a different perspective that not only deals with estimation of epoch instances (i.e., glottal activity) but also with quantification of the absence of epochs (i.e., no glottal activity) in the unvoiced regions of speech signal. Most of the epoch detection methods perform significantly well in the voiced regions of speech but are not robust enough in the unvoiced regions of speech, i.e., they detect a number of pseudo epochs in the unvoiced regions of speech. We propose a simple method based on Teager Energy Operator (TEO) which not only determines the epochs in voiced region (due to its superior temporal resolution and its ability to capture airflow properties through the glottis) but also is very effective in unvoiced region. Recently proposed methods such as 0-Hz resonator-based method and DYPSA method gave a combined rate (CR) (for detecting epochs in voiced and unvoiced regions of speech) of 74.7% and 60%, respectively and a pseudo epoch rate (PER) (i.e., spurious epochs in the unvoiced regions of speech) of 62.9% and 54.04%, respectively. On the other hand, our proposed method gave a CR and PER of 87% and 0.27%, respectively. This result suggests that the proposed method captures glottal activity more efficiently both in voiced and unvoiced regions of speech signal. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using publicly available CMU-Arctic database using the epoch information from the electro-glottograph (EGG) as reference signal to serve as ground truth for estimation of glottal closure instants (GCI). Due to the noise suppression capability of TEO, the proposed method has almost no or little effect (i.e., robust) against signal degradations like white, babble, high frequency and vehicle noises as compared to 0-Hz resonator and DYPSA methods.\n",

            "Abstract: Since the last decade, hybrid electric vehicles have been and are introduced increasingly by automotive industry as they provide substantial improvements in fuel consumption. However, the optimal power distribution between the different energy sources in a HEV to achieve high efficiency is a non trivial problem. In a former work, an approximate solution to the generic optimization task by a two-stage approach based on linear programming and switching strategies was introduced, which is extended within this work. First, the opportunity to declutch and switch off the internal combustion engine is considered, which extends the linear program to a mixed integer linear program and leads to additional improvements in fuel consumption. The second extension introduces a receding horizon strategy that considers the current and a target state of charge of the battery at the end of the horizon during the top level optimization. Thus a complete knowledge of the driving cycle is not required but only a prediction for a shorter horizon. Furthermore, errors caused by model-plant mismatch and prediction can be compensated by the SOC feedback. Both extensions result in a minimum increase in computational effort and allow to formulate the optimization as mixed integer linear program and solve it by real-time capable solvers. As application example a parallel hybrid electric vehicle with realistic models of battery and powertrain and the opportunity to declutch the internal combustion engine is considered. The method and the proposed extensions are evaluated in simulation and experimental in which satisfactory results could be achieved in both cases.\n",

Instead of sequential access to the video contents, the structuring and modeling of video data so that users can quickly and easily browse and retrieve interesting materials has become an important issue in designing multimedia information systems. An abstract semantic model called the augmented transition network (ATN), which can model video data and user interactions, is proposed in this paper. An ATN and its subnetworks can model video data based on different granularities, such as scenes, shots and key frames. Multimedia input strings are used as inputs for ATNs. The details of how to use multimedia input strings to model video data are also discussed. Key frame selection is based on the temporal and spatial relations of semantic objects in each shot. These relations are captured from our proposed unsupervised video segmentation method, which considers the problem of partitioning each frame as a joint estimation of the partition and class parameter variables. Unlike existing semantic models, which only model multimedia presentation, multimedia database searching or browsing, ATNs together with multimedia input strings can model these three in one framework.\n",

            "Abstract: Traditional testing techniques are not adequate for Web-based applications. Nowadays, Web applications depend more and more on the back-end database to provide much more functionalities. Additionally, database interactions make a great impact on the navigation of Web applications. In this paper, we propose an event-based dependence graph models (EDGMs) to model and extracting database interactions in Web applications. A FSM was used as a tool to model the presentation (.aspx) of Web page. And Control Flow Graph (CFG) and Database Interaction Flow Graph (DIFG) are employed to extracted and model its corresponding logical process (.cs) of each corresponding page. From the EDGMs, a FSM test-tree (FSM-TT) was constructed. Based on FSM-TT, the test sequences were generated. At last, by elaborating the test sequences with the FSMs of Web pages, we got the more detailed test sequences which can be easily instantiated and test executed.\n",

            "Abstract: We investigate whether XCS, a genetic algorithm based learning classifier system, can harness information from a user's environment to help desktop applications better personalize themselves to individual users. Specifically, we evaluate XCSs ability to predict user-preferred actions for a calendar and a media player. Results from three real-world user studies indicate that XCS significantly outperforms a decision-tree learner to successfully predict user preferences for these two desktop interfaces. Our results also show that removing external user-related contextual information degrades XCSs performance. This performance degradation emphasizes the need for desktop applications to access external contextual information to better learn user preferences. Our results highlight the potential for a learning classifier systems based approach for personalizing desktop applications to improve the quality of human-computer interaction.\n",

            "Abstract: A head-mounted projective display (HMPD) consists of a pair of miniature projection lenses, beam splitters and displays mounted on the helmet and retro-reflective sheeting materials placed strategically in the environment. This has recently been proposed as an alternative to existing 3D visualization devices. In this paper, we first briefly review HMPD technology, including its featured capabilities and the recent development in both display implementations and applications. Then the implementation of a testbed for playing a \"Go\" game with a remote opponent in a 3D augmented environment is described. The testbed not only demonstrates the capabilities of virtual-real augmentation and registration, the natural occlusion of virtual objects by real ones, interaction with augmented environments and networking collaboration, but also embodies part of our long-term objective to develop a collaborative framework in 3D augmented environments. Through the testbed, major calibration issues, such as accommodation/convergence considerations and determination of viewing transformations, are studied and discussed in detail. Both calibration methods and results are included, which are applicable to other applications. Finally, experimental results of the testbed implementation are presented.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper introduces a new subpixel classification algorithm that incorporates prior information from known class proportions in the linear mixture model. The prior information is expressed in terms of the occurrence probabilities of each land-cover class in a pixel. The use of different error cost functions that measure the similarity between the model-derived mixed spectra and the observed spectra is also investigated. Under these assumptions, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) methodology is employed for optimization. Finally, optimization problems under the MAP criteria for different error cost functions are formulated and solved. Our numerical results illustrate that the performance of the subpixel classification algorithm can be significantly improved by incorporating prior information from the known class proportions. Furthermore, there are marginal differences in accuracy when different error cost functions are used.\n",

We have designed a new algorithm to locate cells and propose an energy function to be used together with a stochastic deformable template model.

At the low-end of this technology are the clusters of SMP PCs, usually based on Pentium Pro or Pentium II processors. Many groups in the academia and in the industry are setting up such clusters with big expectations. However, how far can one go with a cluster of SMP PCs when the goal is high performance computing? This paper discusses several aspects regarding the adoption of clusters of SMP PCs to support high performance computing including software and hardware restraints to deliver processing power to parallel applications, as well as the most innovative alternatives to overcome these restraints. Besides discussing the current state of PC cluster computing, the authors identify further enhancements that will help to enable these low-cost machines to join the HPC universe.\n",

            "Abstract: The effects of aluminum implantation on HfO2 thin films using plasma immersion ion implantation (Al– PIII samples) are investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements reveal that most of the implanted aluminum atoms accumulated near the surface region of the oxide film. The greatly reduced leakage current, smaller flatband shift and steep transition from the accumulation to the depletion region in the capacitance–voltage characteristics for Al–PIII samples indicate that both bulk oxide and interface traps are significantly reduced by aluminum incorporation. Even though the aluminum concentration at the Si/HfO2 interface is very low the results indicate that trace amount of aluminum at the interface leads to significant improvements in both material and electrical characteristics of the thin HfO2 films.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of multiservice support in IEEE 802.16 or WiMAX networks. The capacity for supporting multiple service classes is indeed important for any access technology where bandwidth is limited, which is the case for IEEE 802.16. The standard currently proposes four traffic classes, and specifies that for uplink traffic, the first one (UGS) receives periodic grants whereas the other three are served via polling. Supporting two different scheduling mechanisms may have a significant impact on the complexity of network interface cards, and therefore on the CAPEX for WiMAX networks. Based on this analysis, the present work investigates whether a 802.16 network that only supports the 3 polling based classes is still capable of providing the QoS levels expected for all types of applications. Both the transfer plane QoS, in terms of latency and jitter, and the command plane QoS, in terms of blocking probability are assessed. In particular, a simple, multiservice call admission control (CAC) mechanism is proposed that significantly improves on a previously proposed CAC mechanism by favouring real time traffic over non real time traffic. The outcome of this study shows that it is indeed possible to support stringent QoS with only polling based traffic classes, and fairly simple traffic engineering mechanisms fully described in the paper.\n",

Hemodynamic is a branch of physiology and is a complex system which deals with the study of blood flow in arteries. We study the complex physical system of blood flow in a narrow artery with asymmetric stenos is in the presence of external magnetic field, treating blood as Herschel-Bulkey fluid model. Finite difference scheme is applied to solve the resulting system of nonlinear partial differential equations with appropriate initial and boundary conditions. The finite difference schemes for the velocity distribution, skin friction, flow rate and longitudinal impedance to flow are obtained. It is found that the velocity decreases with the increase of the magnetic field and pressure gradient reverse behavior is noticed when the yield stress and depth of the stenos is increase. It is also observed that the flow rate decreases with the increase of the stenos is shape parameter, power law index and yield stress. Also, it is noted that the presence of external magnetic field influences the mean velocity by increasing its magnitude significantly in arteries of different radii.\n",

Both EBF and EBR perform bit loading in two stages and are able to converge to the optimal bit-allocation profile. In the first stage, an intermediate bit-allocation profile, which is tightly close to the final bit-allocation profile, is obtained by using our proposed group-by-group bit filling (for EBF) or group-by-group bit removal (for EBR). In the second stage, the well-known greedy bit filling (for EBF) or greedy bit removal (for EBR) is performed for the remaining bits (usually of a small size). Analytical and numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithms converge to the optimal bit allocation with much lower computational complexities than existing optimal algorithms. It is also shown that the proposed algorithms outperform typical suboptimal algorithms in power efficiency with relatively higher computational complexities.\n",

            "Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present a robust tracking control algorithm for underactuated biped robots capable of self-balancing in the presence of external disturbances. The biped is modeled as a five-link planar robot with four actuators located at hip and knee joints. A sliding mode control law has been developed for the biped to follow a human-like gait trajectory while keeping the torso nearly upright. The control forces are calculated by defining four first-order sliding surfaces as a linear combination of the torso and the four joint tracking errors. The control approach is shown to guarantee that all trajectories will reach and stay on these surfaces during each step, while the walking cycle stability is maintained through a Lyapunov function. The criteria for asymptotic stability of the surfaces are presented and a numerical search method is implemented for the selection of the corresponding surface parameters. The paper further investigates the robustness of the controller in response to disturbances. Numerical simulations demonstrate the tracking stability of the biped's multistep walk and its human-like response to an external disturbance.\n",

With each BG/Q node having 68 hardware threads, hybrid programming paradigms, which use message passing among nodes and multi-threading within nodes, are ideal and will enable applications to achieve high throughput on BG/Q. With such unprecedented massive parallelism and scale, this paper is a groundbreaking effort to explore the design challenges for designing a communication library that can match and exploit such massive parallelism In particular, we present the Parallel Active Messaging Interface (PAMI) library as our BG/Q library solution to the many challenges that come with a machine at such scale. PAMI provides (1) novel techniques to partition the application communication overhead into many contexts that can be accelerated by communication threads, (2) client and context objects to support multiple and different programming paradigms, (3) lockless algorithms to speed up MPI message rate, and (4) novel techniques leveraging the new BG/Q architectural features such as the scalable atomic primitives implemented in the L2 cache, the highly parallel hardware messaging unit that supports both point-to-point and collective operations, and the collective hardware acceleration for operations such as broadcast, reduce, and all reduce.

In this paper we focus on a feature generation process that is based on the linear transformation of an original log-spectral representation. While conventional linear feature generation methods generally use objective functions that are not closely related to recognition accuracy, our linear feature generation method attempts to find a transformation matrix that maximizes the normalized acoustic likelihood of the most likely state training data, a measure that is directly related to the classification error rate in speech recognition. The transformation matrix is generated using a gradient ascent optimization process, with the normalized acoustic likelihood of the most likely state sequence as the objective function. Experimental results using the DARPA RM corpus show that the proposed method consistently decreases word error rates compared to conventional linear feature generation methods.\n",

            "Abstract: The inferior olive (IO) possesses synaptic glomeruli, which contain dendritic spines from neighboring neurons and presynaptic terminals, many of which are inhibitory and GABAergic. Gap junctions between the spines electrically couple neighboring neurons whereas the GABAergic synaptic terminals are thought to act to decrease the effectiveness of this coupling. Thus, the glomeruli are thought to be important for determining the oscillatory and synchronized activity displayed by IO neurons. Indeed, the tendency to display such activity patterns is enhanced or reduced by the local administration of the GABA-A receptor blocker picrotoxin (PIX) or the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX), respectively. We studied the functional roles of the glomeruli by solving the inverse problem of estimating the inhibitory (g\"i) and gap-junctional conductance (g\"c) using an IO network model. This model was built upon a prior IO network model, in which the individual neurons consisted of soma and dendritic compartments, by adding a glomerular compartment comprising electrically coupled spines that received inhibitory synapses. The model was used in the forward mode to simulate spike data under PIX and CBX conditions for comparison with experimental data consisting of multi-electrode recordings of complex spikes from arrays of Purkinje cells (complex spikes are generated in a one-to-one manner by IO spikes and thus can substitute for directly measuring IO spike activity). The spatiotemporal firing dynamics of the experimental and simulation spike data were evaluated as feature vectors, including firing rates, local variation, auto-correlogram, cross-correlogram, and minimal distance, and were contracted onto two-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) space. g\"c and g\"i were determined as the solution to the inverse problem such that the simulation and experimental spike data were closely matched in the PCA space. The goodness of the match was confirmed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the PCA scores between the experimental and simulation spike data. In the PIX condition, g\"i was found to decrease to approximately half its control value. CBX caused an approximately 30% decrease in g\"c from control levels. These results support the hypothesis that the glomeruli are control points for determining the spatiotemporal characteristics of olivocerebellar activity and thus may shape its ability to convey signals to the cerebellum that may be used for motor learning or motor control purposes.\n",

Each phalanx of our hand model consists of a number of deformable soft bodies, which dynamically adapt to the shape of grasped objects based on the applied forces. Stronger forces directly result in larger contact areas, which increase the friction between hand and object as would occur in reality. For a robust collision-based soft body simulation, we extended the lattice-shape matching algorithm to work with adaptive stiffness values, which are dynamically derived from force and velocity thresholds. Our implementation demonstrates that this approach allows very precise and robust grasping, manipulation and releasing of virtual objects and performs in real-time for a variety of complex scenarios. Additionally, laborious tuning of object and friction parameters is not necessary for the wide range of objects that we typically grasp with our hands.\n",

On the other hand, by setting an a priori positivity constraint to the processing algorithm could be a heavy restriction to its performances. It is worthwhile, then, to look for a state-space realization through combination of positive systems. In this paper a state-space representation for a class of MIMO systems is proposed in the discrete-time framework. The approach followed provides an easy implementation by means of combinations of positive systems, whose total order is fixed regardless of the poles location in the complex plane. The stability of the positive realization of a stable system is also investigated.\n",

The results are also compared to those obtained by the simplified model, which was developed previously based on the assumption that the friction between the base and the ground is high enough to prevent the base from skidding forward or backward. The results clearly show that the friction properties between the wheels and the ground affect machine stability. Thus, one has to include the frictional effect in order to accurately predict the tip-over behavior of mobile manipulators.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we study a service procurement problem with uncertainty as to whether service providers are capable of completing a given task within a specifie deadline. This type of setting is often encountered in large and dynamic multi-agent systems, such as computational Grids or clouds. To effectively deal with this uncertainty, the consumer may dynamically and redundantly procure multiple services over time, in order to increase the probability of success, while at the same time balancing this with the additional procurement costs. However, in order to do this optimally, the consumer requires information about the providers' costs and their success probabilities over time. This information is typically held privately by the providers and they may have incentives to misreport this, so as to increase their own profits To address this problem, we introduce a novel mechanism that incentivises self-interested providers to reveal their true costs and capabilities, and we show that this mechanism is ex-post incentive compatible, efficien and individually rational. However, for these properties to hold, it generally needs to compute the optimal solution, which can be intractable in large settings. Therefore, we show how we can generate approximate solutions while maintaining the economic properties of the mechanism. This approximation admits a polynomial-time solution that can be computed in seconds even for hundreds of providers, and we demonstrate empirically that it performs as well as the optimal in typical scenarios. In particularly challenging settings, we show that it still achieves 97% or more of the optimal.\n",

            "Abstract: Suboptimal detection schemes, such as list MIMO detection, often face the challenge of having to ldquoguessrdquo at the decision reliability for some of the detected bits. A simple yet effective way of doing this is to set the maximum magnitudes of the associated log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs) to a certain predefined value: LLR clipping. However, the choice of the clipping level has a significant impact on the system performance. A majority of prior approaches attempted to determine appropriate clipping levels by manual optimization. In this work we propose to use an SNR-aware approach for calculating the LLR clipping levels in list MIMO detection. The proposed scheme exploits knowledge of the channel state information to determine the instantaneous bit error probability of the list detector, and from this an appropriate level for clipping of the LLRs. Simulation results show that this strategy outperforms schemes using a fixed clipping level.\n",

This article first analyzes the compositionality problem and traces it back to the invalidity of the Law of the Excluded Middle. It then characterizes the semantics via a particular class of linear intuitionistic Kripke models. This yields, for the first time in the literature, a simple fully abstract semantics that interprets Pnueli and Shalev's concept of failure naturally. The results not only give insight into the semantic subtleties of Statecharts, but also provide a basis for an implementation, for developing algebraic theories for macro steps, and for comparing different Statecharts variants.\n",

            "Abstract: A new adaptive resource allocation scheme is proposed in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems with rate proportionality constraints. The problem of maximizing the overall system capacity with constraints on bit-error rate, total transmission power and rate-proportionality for user requiring different classes of service is formulated. Since the optimal solution to the constrained fairness problem is extremely complex to obtain, a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm that separates subchannel allocation and power allocation is proposed. Firstly, the number of subchannels to be assigned to each user is determined based on the users' average signal-to-noise ratio and rate-proportion. Subchannels are subsequently distributed according to the modified max-min criterion. Lastly, iterative rate-proportionality tracking algorithm is proposed for maximizing the capacity together with maintaining the rate proportionality constraint. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can distribute the capacity more efficiently and fairly among users than other existing method.\n",

Simple closed-form expressions for the number of packets routed by a single node have been derived, and the main point was to point out that the modeling the energy storage medium, namely the SC, impacts the parameter of interest. Our modeling approach and the subsequent comparisons show that the choice of models implies a significant difference in the throughput per node.\n",

            "Abstract: The Julia programming language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community: 1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature 2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientic programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientic computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems. In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after dierences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most importantly, human convenience.\n",

            "Abstract: Freight and passenger carriers deploy large hub-and-spoke transportation networks to provide efficient service between many origins and many destinations. These networks use hub facilities that provide a connecting, sorting and/or consolidation function designed to concentrate flows on the inter-hub links to exploit the strong economies of scale in transportation. Yet examination of the optimal solutions of hub location models reveals that the flows on spoke arcs quite often exceed the flows between hubs, which violates the premise underlying the model for economies of scale. This paper provides computational results for a range of hub location problem types and data sets to document this disconnect between the assumed model for transportation cost and the actual optimal flows. This raises an important question for hub location research using the basic model for economies of scale. Some interesting differences between flows in passenger and freight hub networks are also highlighted.\n",

            "Abstract: In the same sense as classical logic is a formal theory of truth, the recently initiated approach called  computability logic  is a formal theory of computability. It understands (interactive) computational problems as games played by a machine against the environment, their computability as existence of a machine that always wins the game, logical operators as operations on computational problems, and validity of a logical formula as being a scheme of “always computabl ” problems. Computability logic has been introduced semantically, and now among its main technical goals is to axiomatize the set of valid formulas or various natural fragments of that set. The present contribution signifies a first step towards this goal. It gives a detailed exposition of a soundness and completeness proof for the rather new type of a deductive propositional system  CL1 , the logical vocabulary of which contains operators for the so called  parallel  and  choice  operations, and the atoms of which represent  elementary problems , that is, predicates in the standard sense.This article is self-contained as it explains all relevant concepts.

            "Abstract: Complexity is considered with high interest to texture analysis, such as the application of lymphoma inspection. Previously, multiscale entropy was proposed to account for the multiple time scales inherent in complex biological signals, and complexity texture descriptors were considered for content-based medical image retrieval system. However, in the past, these complexity texture descriptors were derived by linear algorithms of Fourier and wavelet transforms. In this study, we introduce a new approach of multiscale complexity (MSC) for texture analysis of lymphomas based on a nonlinear parameter of entropy. An extended algorithm of 2-D entropy was used in the calculations of complexities for the coarse-grained images of different scale factors. Furthermore, five parameters are defined to characterize 58 images of reactive lymphadenopahty and five categories of lymphomas using complexity on three scales and the changes of complexity between two successive scales. MSC analysis performed well to figure out the statistical differences of paired comparisons picked from reactive lymphadenopahty and five categories of lymphomas.\n",

            "Abstract: Projective clustering is a clustering technique for high dimensional data with the inherent sparsity of the data points. To overcome the unreliable measure of similarity among data points in high dimensions, all data points are projected to a lower dimensional sub-space. Principal component analysis (PCA) is an efficient method to dimensionality reduction by projecting all points to a lower dimensional subspace so that the information loss is minimized. However, PCA does not handle well the situation that different clusters are formed in different subspaces. We propose a method of multiple principal component analysis for iteratively computing projective clusters. The objective function is designed to determine the subspace associated with each cluster. Some experiments have been carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",

            "Abstract: The sea surface temperature (SST) data availability by infrared measurement was low compared to microwave measurement. The infrared radiation cannot penetrate the cloud, so their availabilities are severely limited by clouds. The microwave can penetrate the clouds and give accurate SST measurements under clouds. The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) derived SST data has an RMS error of 0.6-0.7 K. TMI is a microwave radiometer onboard the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Satellite. The infrared derived SST data has low data availability but has higher spatial resolution compared to microwave derived data. The spatial resolution of infrared radiometer, Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is about 1km, but the spatial resolution of TMI is 25km. The objective of our study is to increase the spatial resolution of microwave derived SST data and increase the availability of infrared derived SST data. In this study, we used MODIS SST data with grid size of about 0.01? and TMI SST data with grid size of 0.25?. We re-sampled these data into the new map with grid size of 0.1?. We find the new merged SST data from the MODIS SST and TMI SST. If any of the MODIS or TMI SST data is available, then the merged SST was assigned the value of the existing data. If both of the SST data are available, then the new merged SST was given the value of the average of these data. Otherwise, the new SST data was determined by interpolation method. We used the neighbourhood pixels for interpolation. All of the processing steps were programmed in MATLAB code. . However we checked our results by comparing the SST data availability of TMI and MODIS images before processing and data availability of new image after processing.\n",

            "Abstract: Over the past decade, mobile computing and wireless communication have become increasingly important drivers of many new computing applications. The field of wireless sensor networks particularly focuses on applications involving autonomous use of compute, sensing, and wireless communication devices for both scientific and commercial purposes. This paper examines the research decisions and design tradeoffs that arise when applying wireless peer-to-peer networking techniques in a mobile sensor network designed to support wildlife tracking for biology research.The ZebraNet system includes custom tracking collars (nodes) carried by animals under study across a large, wild area; the collars operate as a peer-to-peer network to deliver logged data back to researchers. The collars include global positioning system (GPS), Flash memory, wireless transceivers, and a small CPU; essentially each node is a small, wireless computing device. Since there is no cellular service or broadcast communication covering the region where animals are studied, ad hoc, peer-to-peer routing is needed. Although numerous ad hoc protocols exist, additional challenges arise because the researchers themselves are mobile and thus there is no fixed base station towards which to aim data. Overall, our goal is to use the least energy, storage, and other resources necessary to maintain a reliable system with a very high `data homing' success rate. We plan to deploy a 30-node ZebraNet system at the Mpala Research Centre in central Kenya. More broadly, we believe that the domain-centric protocols and energy tradeoffs presented here for ZebraNet will have general applicability in other wireless and sensor applications.\n",

We compare the performance of FOBS with that of TCP both with and without the so-called Large Window extensions designed to improve the performance of TCP in this type of network environment. It is shown that FOBS can obtain on the order of 90% of the available bandwidth across both short and long high-performance network connections. In the case of the long haul connection, this represents a bandwidth that is 1.8 times higher than that of the optimized TCP algorithm. Also, we demonstrate that the additional traffic placed on the network due to the greedy nature of the algorithm is quite reasonable, representing approximately 3% of the total data transferred.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper is an attempt at providing a fuzzy set-based formalization of case-based reasoning. The proposed approach assumes a principle stating that the more similar are the problem description attributes, the more similar are the outcome attributes. If this principle is accepted it induces constraints on the fuzzy similarity relations which are acceptable with respect to the cases stored in the memory. The idea of having cases in the memory with different Ievels of typicality is also discussed. A weaker form of this principle concluding only on the graded possibility of the similarity of the outcome attributes, is also considered. These two forms of the case-based reasoning principle are modelled in terms of fuzzy rules. Then an approximate reasoning machinery taking advantage of this principle enables us to apply the information stored in the memory of previous cases to the current problem. Extensions of the proposed approach in order to handle incomplete or fuzzy descriptions is also considered and studied. The paper does not take into account the learning aspects of case-based reasoning.\n",

A new objective function is constructed, and a suboptimal procedure to segment and estimate moving objects in a scene is proposed. Each object is represented by chain-coded block boundaries, affine motion parameters, and motion-compensated prediction error. A number of experimental comparisons between block- and object-oriented coding schemes suggests a significant potential coding gain using object-oriented motion-compensated coding. >\n",

In contrast to the multicarrier carrier (MC) transmissions, e.g., OFDM, the FB based approach avoids the use of cyclic prefix (CP) or guard band and offers a number of superior properties such as synchronization, and peak to average power ratio (PAPR), etc. However, due to the lack of practical diversity techniques and cost effective equalizers, the broadband SC signal can hardly be deployed under highly dispersive channel environment. We propose a practical FB based selection diversity based on non-maximally decimated filter banks with perfect reconstruction support (PR-NMDFB) with its companion linear equalizer in the FB transformed domain. We shall give detailed minimum mean square error (MMSE) and bit error rate (BER) analysis and compare it to the optimal maximum ratio combining (MRC) solution.\n",

The subjects are 19 demented patients, 18 normal elders and 7 healthy young volunteers. The adopted velocities of pursuing target are 300, 400 and 500 pixel/s. As diagnosing parameters, we have adopted the switching time of internal & external rectus muscles, max velocities and peaks of oculogyration. As a conclusion, the real-time measurement of human oculogyration seems to become a new diagnosing method of the dementia because the smooth pursuit of the demented patients has presented clear deviations from the healthy elders. Especially the pursuit velocity, peak value, switching time and correlation coefficient seems to be very useful to discriminate the demented patients from the healthy elder subjects objectively.\n",

            "Abstract: The proliferation of wireless technology, mobile computing, and increasingly sophisticated video codecs have fueled the sharp increase in demand for user-centric applications involving wireless video streaming. Consequently, it is becoming progressively more important to ensure that wirelessly transmitted video signals are delivered with optimal perceptual quality to the end-user. This is in contrast to traditional QoS, which aims to optimize system and packet-level performance, but not necessarily perceptual quality. In order to drive towards this goal, one of the most important evolutions to modern video streaming systems will be the adaptive allocation of both wireless and video coding resources at the transmitter - ideally according to a cost function designed to optimize some measure of the received perceptual video quality. Unfortunately, it is not at all likely that a transmitting station will have access to the video signal received by the end-user, and therefore, this precludes the possibility of using such a perceptually-oriented cost function. Indeed, current resource allocation strategies are based on simplistic packet-statistic-based estimates of the received video quality, and one can easily demonstrate that this results in suboptimal perceptual video quality to the end-user. In this paper, we propose a simple, but powerful technique which allows a transmitting station to obtain an accurate estimate of the video signal seen by the recipient using cross-layer feedback between the wireless MAC and the video encoder, thus enabling the transmitter to use more perceptually oriented resource allocation strategies. We support the proposed technique through both simulation and experiments involving a database of over 420 distorted H.264 AVC compressed video sequences.\n",

Specifically, a nonlinear optimization problem is firstly formulated and solved to find joint velocities and contact forces to impart a desired motion to the object at each time step. Then, the relative velocity at the contact point is found by calculating the velocity of the fingertip and the object at the contact point. Finally, time derivatives of the surface variables and the contact angle of the fingertip and the object at the current time step is computed using the Montana's contact equation to find the contact parameters of the fingertip and the object at the next time step. To show the validity of the proposed algorithm, a numerical example is illustrated by using the robotic hand manipulating a circular cylinder with three fingers each of which has four joints.\n",

With a sample of relatively mature articles, we show that referencing does not occur regularly through an article's lifetime but is associated with periods of more substantial editing, when the article has reached a certain level of maturity (in terms of the number of times it has been revised and its length). References also tend to be contributed by editors who have contributed more frequently and more substantially to an article, suggesting that a subset of more qualified or committed editors may exist for each article.\n",

The argument might be of more general interest, beyond the specifics of the proposed axiomatization, as it highlights the interaction of the notion of Dedekind-finiteness and the induction principle.\n",

In contrast to related algorithms in this field, our framework guarantees that the total impulse response power, the mean delay, as well as the RMS delay spread of every input impulse response remains unchanged if a solution is found. The phase angles of the output impulse response are chosen such that the magnitude error of the channel realization in the frequency domain is minimized as well.\n",

CI provides useful data on the typical problems found in various tools for developing mobile applications on which our design ideas were based.

            "Abstract: NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) have collected a great diversity of geological science results, thanks in large part to their surface mobility capabilities. The six wheel rocker/bogie mobility system provides driving capabilities in a range of terrain types, while the onboard IMU measures actual rover attitude changes (roll, pitch and yaw, but not position) quickly and accurately. Four stereo camera pairs provide accurate position knowledge and/or terrain assessment. Solar panels generally provide enough energy to drive the vehicle for at most four hours each day, but drive time is often restricted by other planned activities. Driving along slopes in nonhomogeneous terrain injects unpredictable amounts of slip into each drive. These restrictions led to the creation of driving strategies that alternately use more or less onboard autonomy, to maximize drive speed and distance at the cost of increased complexity in the sequences of commands built by human Rover Planners each day.#R##N##R##N#Commands to the MER vehicles are typically transmitted at most once per day, so mobility operations are encoded as event-driven sequences of individual motion commands. Motions may be commanded using quickly-executing Directed commands which perform only reactive motion safety checks (e.g., real-time current limits, maximum instantaneous vehicle tilt limit), slowly-executing position measuring Visual Odometry (VisOdom) commands, which use images to accurately update the onboard position estimate, or slow-to-medium speed Autonomous Navigation (AutoNav) commands, which use onboard image processing to perform predictive terrain safety checks and optional autonomous Path Selection.#R##N##R##N#In total, the MER rovers have driven more than 10 kilometers over Martian terrain during their first 21 months of operation using these basic modes. In this paper we describe the strategies adopted for selecting between human-planned Directed drives versus rover-adaptive Autonomous Navigation, Visual Odometry and Path Selection drives.\n",

In this paper, we present three computationally efficient iterative receivers for joint channel estimation and data detection in SIMO systems. These receivers result from an application of the expectation-maximization (EM) and the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithms. Bit error rate (BER) performance of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) receivers with perfect channel state information (CSI) is plotted and compared with the BER performance of the proposed iterative receivers. Proposed receivers exhibit near ML performance with a few iterations.\n",

            "Abstract: Broadband broadcast and multicast wireless systems usually employ OFDM modulations (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) combined with non-uniform hierarchical constellations. However, these schemes are very prone to nonlinear distortion effects and have high carrier synchronization requirements. SC-FDE (Single-Carrier with Frequency-Domain Equalization) is an attractive alternative for OFDM, especially when an efficient power amplification is intended. In this paper we consider the use of SC-FDE schemes combined with non-uniform hierarchical constellations in broadband broadcast and multicast wireless systems. We study the impact of residual CFO (Carrier Frequency Offset) on the performance of multi-resolution schemes and we propose iterative frequency domain receivers with joint detection and carrier synchronization to cope with residual CFO estimation errors (a coarse CFO estimation and compensation is assumed before the equalization procedure). Our results show that while a very high carrier synchronization accuracy is required for the least protected bits, the most protected bits are relatively robust to the CFO. By employing the proposed receiver we increase significantly the robustness to residual CFO estimation errors.\n",

            "Abstract: Many sensitive devices are based on Wheatstone bridge structures or can be modeled as Wheatstone bridges like Hall effect magnetic sensors. These sensors require a biasing circuit, and many solutions were proposed. However, up to now, none of them gives the opportunity to cascade several sensors, while such a cascade can help in improving the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) or in removing some parasitic effects through the direct summing/subtraction of sensing/parasitic effects. The circuit this paper presents is based on an operational transconductance amplifier with n output stages, and allows to cascade n Wheatstone-bridge-like sensors. It is shown that the maximal number of bridges which can be efficiently cascaded is limited by the output resistance of the output stages. Nevertheless, this number remains sufficient in practical cases, easily up to n=10. To remove the 1/f noise coming from the output stages, a chopper stabilization is used. We also establish formulas which allow quick hand calculation of the main parameters of the circuit. A prototype where 10 Hall effect sensors are cascaded is presented as well as experimental results.\n",

            "Abstract: A new, recursive, space-subdivision algorithm for rasterizing algebraic curves and surfaces gets its accuracy from a newly devised, computationally efficient, and asymptotically correct test. The approach followed is essentially the interval arithmetic method for rendering implicit curves. The author's contribution is a particularly efficient way to construct inclusion functions for polynomials. An ideal algorithm is given for rendering an algebraic curve Z(f)={(x,y):f(x,y)=0} in a square box of side n. The algorithm scans the square and paints only those pixels cut by the curve. This algorithm is ideal, because every correct algorithm should paint exactly the same pixels, but it is impractical. It requires n/sup 2/ test evaluations, one for each pixel in the square. However, since in general it will be rendering a curve on a planar region, the number of pixels it is expected to paint is only O(n). We need a more efficient algorithm. There are two issues to examine. The first is how to reduce the computational complexity by recursive subdivision. The second is how to test whether the curve Z(f) cuts a square. >\n",

            "Abstract: This paper describes a design of a fine-grain multiple-valued field-programmable VLSI (MV-FPVLSI) based on multiple-valued source-coupled logic (MVSCL). An MV-FPVLSI consists of identical cells, each of which is connected to 8-neighborhood ones through 1-bit switch block for each direction. An arbitrary 2-variable binary logic operation is realized using threshold logic gates. Using 0.35 /spl mu/m standard CMOS design rule, a bit-serial adder is designed using the MV-FPVLSI. Using HSPICE simulation tools, a cell is evaluated and compared with corresponding binary implementation. Comparison results show that, under normalized power consumption better performance can be achieved if the linear summation with weight 1 of the input currents is possible. Moreover, the area of a cell can be reduced to 24% without any degradation in performance. That is, highly-parallel operations can be done using the MV-FPVLSI under total chip area constraint.\n",

            "Abstract: As of December 2011, 110,629 Americans are waiting for an organ transplant and yet only 28,664 people received organ transplants in 2010. This fact alone demonstrates the USA is facing an organ shortage crisis. Added to this, there is strong evidence that the organs made available are not being used efficiently, with 20 % of them going unused (for kidneys). It is tempting to investigate how new allocation policies could be implemented, but it would be more prudent to first understand the structure of the organ donation system in the USA. In spite of availability of data on transplants, to our knowledge no proper analysis has been done using the available data. This paper looks at organ transplantation data and what its structure may reveal about the allocation process currently in place. In order to structure the data, we used techniques from network sciences to build a network of locations (henceforth called a geographical social network, GSN) representing all transplants in the USA since 1987—locations represent states or zipcodes in the USA. This social structure is then analyzed using techniques from network sciences to bring clarity to the organ donation process. One of the main items in organ donation policies is the issue of locality which argues that allocation mechanisms should try to prioritize patients who are near the location where the organ became available. This is an important issue because the longer the organ takes to be transplanted the worse its quality. We show that network science techniques may shed some light on this process and demonstrate inconsistencies across different organs.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents an efficient method for managing Monte Carlo simulation experiments to select the optimal circuit design from a set of candidates. Simulation is a useful tool for evaluating and comparing circuit designs since it measures the impact of component variability. However, its use in circuit design has traditionally been limited to problems with a small number of design candidates due to its large computational requirements. We outline a solution method that has been successfully used in other contexts to improve the efficiency of simulation-based optimization. The method works in an iterative fashion to intelligently allocate a limited computing budget across multiple design alternatives in order to maximize the probability of correct selection. We illustrate the method's potential benefits for circuit design problems through two simple examples. The examples confirm that the method yields significant savings in computational time, making simulation-based experiments a feasible option for larger circuit design problems.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents a distributed power allocation (PA) algorithm for the downlink of relay enhanced cellular networks. The PA problem is built into a non-cooperative game where a utility function is formulated and maximized. The utility function is comprised of two parts considering the interests of the node B and the relay node respectively, which facilitates the distributed PA on the nodes. Since the relay user's data rate is constrained by the minimum capacity of the two hops, a novel pricing function is developed to avoid allocating excess power to the second hop when the capacity is inferior in the first hop. The proposed game theoretic approach is compared with the uniform power allocation and the pure iterative water-filling method. Simulation results show that within a few steps of iteration, the proposed scheme can not only achieve the highest system capacity, but also efficiently balance the capacities of relay users in the two hops.\n",

Unfortunately, in many cases the construction of these functionals is not an easy task. This is the case of the model describing hematopoiesis, which is a nonlinear system with distributed delays, which, according to some conditions, admits one or two equilibrium points. By contrast with approaches already used to study this model, we analyze the stability properties of its equilibrium points by constructing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals of two types.\n",

            "Abstract: Recent advances in device miniaturization have clearly contributed to make Weiser's vision of ubiquitous computing closer to reality. However, such vision is still far from being accomplished because some difficult problems remain to be solved. It is still hard to develop applications that take advantage of the disappearance of the real/virtual barrier, and to support such applications in a way that can be easily integrated with current environments. We propose a middleware approach (OSMOSIS) that employs pragmatic approach to solve the previous drawbacks so that ubiquitous computing can become a reality. It provides a file-system abstraction in order to make real objects virtual so that each real-world object has a virtual counterpart in the form of a file. Thus, the topology of a workplace, or a house, is reflected in the directories and subdirectories organization. The OSMOSIS middleware combines the use of RFID, Location and Context Management and a Policy Engine in order to provide to applications a context-aware file-system enriched with semantic-information.\n",

For non-uniform loops, an innovative and efficient parallelization approach based on convex theory have been proposed and is being implemented.

Regarding to IR drop effect mitigation, an optimization technique is proposed based on Simulated Annealing that minimize total power stripe area while satisfying a given IR drop constraint. In consideration of multiple power domains, the given power domains are represented in tree-like structure and our algorithm is recursively applied to synthesize and optimize the power network for each power domain in a hierarchical fashion. The proposed methodology is integrated to commercial design tool and experimented on real design case for evaluation. To ensure practical aspect of our approach, evaluation is performed on latest digital design commercial tool. Design data and parameters are extracted using Open Access. The result of our algorithm is fed back to latest commercial tool for final IR and EM analysis. Our algorithm is tested on both industrial testcase and academic MCNC benchmark.

The goal of our system is to support the query specification process by using each pixel of the display to represent one data item of the database. By arranging and coloring the pixels according to their relevance for the query, the user gets a visual impression of the resulting data set. Using sliders for each condition of the query, the user may change the query dynamically and receives immediate feedback by the visual representation of the resulting data set. By using multiple windows for different parts of a complex query, the user gets visual feedback for each part of the query and, therefore, will easier understand the overall result. The system may be used to query any database that contains tens of thousands to millions of data items, but it is especially helpful to explore large data sets with an unknown distribution of values and to find the interesting hot spots in huge amounts of data. The direct feedback allows to visually display the influence of incremental query refinements and, therefore, allows a better, easier and faster query specification. >\n",

These approaches are presented in the framework of classical query evaluation procedures that rely upon cost models heavily dependent on metadata (e.g. statistics and cardinality estimates) and that typically are restricted to execution time estimation. There are computational environments where metadata acquisition and support is very expensive. Additionally, execution time is not the only optimization objective of interest. A ubiquitous computing environment is an appropriate example where classical query optimization techniques are not useful any more. In order to solve this problem, this article presents a query optimization technique based on learning, particularly on case-based reasoning. Given a query, the knowledge acquired from previous experiences is exploited in order to propose reasonable solutions. It is possible to learn from each new experience in order to suggest better solutions to solve future queries.\n",

New approaches like flow scheduling are proposed and studied as alternatives to traditional QoS and reservation proposals. To enable such flow scheduling approaches, runtime mechanisms controlling flow sending time and rate have to be implemented in the data plane. This paper quantifies and compares such end-host based mechanisms combined with transport protocols to instantiate different scheduling strategies in a range of latency conditions. We show that, a single-rate scheduling strategy implemented by an AIMD-based protocol and a packet pacing mechanism offers predictable performance and is insensitive to latency. This paper also highlights the limits of other strategies and rate limitation mechanisms like token bucket which generates unpredictability and other drawbacks.\n",

Programs are described as  numeric ,  memory-intensive ,  concurrent , or  object-oriented , based on a qualitative appraisal, in some cases with little justification. We believe it is beneficial to quantify the behaviour of programs with a concise and precisely defined set of metrics, in order to make these intuitive notions of program behaviour more concrete and subject to experimental validation. We therefore define and measure a set of unambiguous, dynamic, robust and architecture-independent metrics that can be used to categorize programs according to their dynamic behaviour in five areas: size, data structure, memory use, concurrency, and polymorphism. A framework computing some of these metrics for Java programs is presented along with specific results demonstrating how to use metric data to understand a program's behaviour, and both guide and evaluate compiler optimizations.\n",

In this paper we explore how themes could be used to enrich automatically generated narratives, and describe how a system which generated story selections in the form of photo montages was developed using a thematic model of narrative. This was achieved by selecting narrative atoms, in this case photographs, from a selection of images on a specific subject with relevance to a desired theme. Our pilot study shows that our thematic system selects images with greater relevance to desired titles, and that the positive impact of thematic selection increases when the images are presented together. We hope that our thematic work will inform others working on narrative systems, and will lead to richer automated narratives.\n",

            "Abstract: The fast polynomial transform (FPT) for computing two-dimensional discrete Fourier transforms is modularized into identical modules. In this new method, only FPTs and fast Fourier transforms of the same length are required. As a consequence, the architecture is more regular and naturally suitable for multiprocessor and VLSI implementations. The modularized FPT algorithms can simplify the problems of control, memory management, load balancing, etc., although more arithmetic operations are needed than with the original ones. >\n",

            "Abstract: This paper analyzes a unit-contingent power purchase agreement between an electricity distributor and a power plant. Under such a contract the distributor pays the plant a fixed price if the plant is operational and nothing if plant outage occurs. Pricing a unit-contingent contract is complicated by the fact that the plant's true status is its private information. The difference between the electricity spot price and the unit-contingent contract price provides an incentive for the plant to misreport its status and earn profit at the distributor's expense. To prevent misreporting, the distributor may inspect the plant and levy penalties if misreporting is discovered. We find that some type of misreporting under certain circumstances can benefit both the plant and the distributor, because it serves as a risk-allocation mechanism between the two parties. We show that such a risk-allocation mechanism is equivalent to using state-contingent options and prohibiting misreporting.\n",

Since texts in natural scenes are not always observed in frontal view, image rectification is needed to robustly recognize them in OCR.

To assist efforts in determining and exploring the functional properties of a protein, it is desirable to automatically identify regions that are prone to undergo conformational changes. It was recently shown that a probabilistic predictor of continuum secondary structure is more accurate than categorical predictors for structurally ambivalent sequence regions, suggesting that such models are suited to characterize protein flexibility.#R##N##R##N#Results: We develop a computational method for identifying regions that are prone to conformational change directly from the amino acid sequence. The method uses the entropy of the probabilistic output of an 8-class continuum secondary structure predictor. Results for 171 unique amino acid sequences with well-characterized variable structure (identified in the 'Macromolecular movements database') indicate that the method is highly sensitive at identifying flexible protein regions, but false positives remain a problem. The method can be used to explore conformational flexibility of proteins (including hypothetical or synthetic ones) whose structure is yet to be determined experimentally.#R##N##R##N#Availability: The predictor, sequence data and supplementary studies are available at http://pprowler.itee.uq.edu.au/sspred/ and are free for academic use.#R##N##R##N#Contact: mikael@itee.uq.edu.au\n",

DE is a well known and uncomplicated population based probabilistic approach for comprehensive optimization. It has apparently outperformed a number of Evolutionary Algorithms and further search heuristics in the vein of Particle Swarm Optimization at what time of testing over both yardstick and actual world problems. Nevertheless, DE, like other probabilistic optimization algorithms, from time to time exhibits precipitate convergence and stagnates at suboptimal position. In order to stay away from stagnation behavior while maintaining an excellent convergence speed, an innovative search strategy is introduced, named memetic search in DE. In the planned strategy, positions update equation customized as per a memetic search stratagem. In this strategy a better solution participates more times in the position modernize procedure. The position update equation is inspired from the memetic search in artificial bee colony algorithm. The proposed strategy is named as Memetic Search in Differential Evolution (MSDE). To prove efficiency and efficacy of MSDE, it is tested over 8 benchmark optimization problems and three real world optimization problems. A comparative analysis has also been carried out among proposed MSDE and original DE. Results show that the anticipated algorithm go one better than the basic DE and its recent deviations in a good number of the experiments.\n",

In this paper, we propose a plug-in architecture for self-adaptive web service composition, in which self-adaptation features are well-modularized in aspect based plug-ins. Our approach supports application-specific adaptation scenarios, is easily extensible, and allows self-adaptation logic to be hot-deployed on running process instances. We have implemented this architecture and several plug-ins using the dynamic aspect-oriented workflow language AO4BPEL.\n",

An RFID tag is a small electronic device with an antenna and has a unique serial number. For some RFID applications and in the ALOHA-based anticollision algorithms, the number of tags in the system needs to be estimated. In Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng., vol 6, no. 1, pp. 9-15, Jan. 2009, Chen, a probabilistic method for tag estimation in ALOHA-based RFID systems was proposed, based on the maximum a posteriori probability. Although this approach is novel and useful, it has a mathematical error in modeling the problem. In this short paper, we address this problem and provide the correct probabilistic model for the ALOHA-based RFID systems. Some consequences of correcting the error in Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng., vol 6, no. 1, pp. 9-15, Jan. 2009, Chen, are discussed and the model is validated via simulation.

            "Abstract: Workflow modeling is a challenging activity and designers are likely to introduce errors, especially in complex industrial processes. Effective process verification is essential at design time because the cost of fixing errors during runtime is substantially higher. However, most user-oriented workflow modeling languages lack formal semantics that hinders such verification. In this paper, we propose a generic approach based on the model transformation to verify workflow processes. The model transformation includes two steps: first, it formalizes the desirable semantics of each modeling element; secondly, it translates a workflow process with clear semantics to an equivalent Petri net. Thus, we can verify the original workflow process using existing Petri net theory and analysis tools. As a comprehensive case study, verifying workflow processes in an industrial modeling language (TiPLM) is presented. Experimental evaluations on verifying real-world business processes validate our approach.\n",

            "Abstract: We use data from the Multispectral Thermal Imager (MTI) to evaluate the effects of spatial resolution on the accuracy of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval. Our results show that increasing the pixel size by itself has little effect on AOD retrieval accuracy at our chosen study site. However, increased pixel size does increase the error in AOD retrieval as a result of clouds. High-resolution sensors like MTI are able to avoid most clouds, but as the pixel size increases, subpixel clouds avoid the cloud mask, creep into selected pixels, and add a positive bias to the retrieved value of AOD. In accompanying work, we show that increasing pixel size has a small but noticeable impact on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 2.2-/spl mu/m reflectance, both used in the retrieval algorithm. We also examine the uniformity of the aerosol layer and show that the AOD varies by less than 0.02 in optical depth units over a 2.3/spl times/3.8 km/sup 2/ area. An analysis of the temporal variability of Aerosol Robotic Network-retrieved AOD shows a standard deviation of 0.02 on partly cloudy days and 0.004 on clear days.\n",

            "Abstract: A video streaming server needs to adapt its source/channel encoding parameters (or configurations) to changes in network conditions and to differences in users' connection profiles. The adaptation can be achieved by adjusting parameters such as frame rate, error protection ratio, and resolution. Ideally, the server should adapt the serving configurations with respect to the current network and user conditions to improve received video quality. However, adaptations that optimize playable frame rate require intensive computation, and storing all possible configurations requires a tremendous amount of storage. This brings forth the issues of how to obtain good video quality and reduce server resources usage at the same time. We address this issue in this paper. Our approach is based on the observation that transcoding between certain configurations can be performed very efficiently. We propose a framework to compute a set of configurations to store on the server by considering two opposing goals: (a) maximizing expected received quality of the video, and (b) minimizing server resource usage by lowering transcoding cost and expected number of switches between configurations. The second objective also reduces the number of configurations, and therefore reduces the total storage required. Our framework models the relationship among different configurations in a partial order, formulates the search of a good set of configurations as an energy minimization problem, and we use techniques in image segmentation to solve the problem. Experimental results show that our framework relieves the server load and increases the number of clients served, while only slightly reducing the expected frame rate.\n",

The solutions produced by these algorithms are Pareto optimum solutions (solutions that are strictly better than any other solution in at least one of the two measures: mean and variance).\n",

The major challenge of PPSs is the development of reliable on-board pedestrian detection systems. Due to the varying appearance of pedestrians (e.g., different clothes, changing size, aspect ratio, and dynamic shape) and the unstructured environment, it is very difficult to cope with the demanded robustness of this kind of system. Two problems arising in this research area are the lack of public benchmarks and the difficulty in reproducing many of the proposed methods, which makes it difficult to compare the approaches. As a result, surveying the literature by enumerating the proposals one--after-another is not the most useful way to provide a comparative point of view. Accordingly, we present a more convenient strategy to survey the different approaches. We divide the problem of detecting pedestrians from images into different processing steps, each with attached responsibilities. Then, the different proposed methods are analyzed and classified with respect to each processing stage, favoring a comparative viewpoint. Finally, discussion of the important topics is presented, putting special emphasis on the future needs and challenges.\n",

This method ensures that AE current features are completely preserved, whereas noise is removed as effectively as possible. The denoised results indicate that the accuracy of the AE current can effectively be improved by employing the proposed scheme.\n",

A framework that integrates Bayesian networks, mixture of gene co-expression models and clustering is proposed to further mine information from the variation of samples within and across classes and enhance the understanding of gene networks. The approach was evaluated on two independent pathways using data from two microarray experiments. Our algorithm succeeded on reconstructing the topology of the gene pathways when benchmarked against empirical reports and randomised data sets. The majority or all the samples within a class shared the same co-expression model and were classified within the corresponding class. Our approach uncovered both gene relationships and profiles that are unique to a particular class or shared across classes.\n",

            "Abstract: An important feature of database technology of the nineties is the use of parallelism for speeding up the execution of complex queries. This technology is being tested in several experimental database architectures and a few commercial systems for conventional select-project-join queries. In particular, hash-based fragmentation is used to distribute data to disks under the control of different processors in order to perform selections and joins in parallel. With the development of new query languages, and in particular with the definition of transitive closure queries and of more general logic programming queries, the new dimension of recursion has been added to query processing. Recursive queries are complex; at the same time, their regular structure is particularly suited for parallel execution, and parallelism may give a high efficiency gain. We survey the approaches to parallel execution of recursive queries that have been presented in the recent literature. We observe that research on parallel execution of recursive queries is separated into two distinct subareas, one focused on the transitive closure of Relational Algebra expressions, the other one focused on optimization of more general Datalog queries. Though the subareas seem radically different because of the approach and formalism used, they have many common features. This is not surprising, because most typical Datalog queries can be solved by means of the transitive closure of simple algebraic expressions. We first analyze the relationship between the transitive closure of expressions in Relational Algebra and Datalog programs. We then review sequential methods for evaluating transitive closure, distinguishing iterative and direct methods. We address the parallelization of these methods, by discussing various forms of parallelization. Data fragmentation plays an important role in obtaining parallel execution; we describe hash-based and semantic fragmentation. Finally, we consider Datalog queries, and present general methods for parallel rule execution; we recognize the similarities between these methods and the methods reviewed previously, when the former are applied to linear Datalog queries. We also provide a quantitative analysis that shows the impact of the initial data distribution on the performance of methods.\n",

            "Abstract: Dynamic frequency management is considered to be beneficial for the uncoordinated self-deployment of Home eNB (HeNB) in LTE-A heterogeneous networks. In this paper, a new autonomous component carrier (CC) selection scheme is proposed that dynamically selects the CC with efficient inter-cell signaling design. The CC selection criterion is to minimize the interference contribution composed of the incoming and outgoing interference. Additionally, power control and weighted proportional fair (PF) scheduling are used to further improve the cell-edge performance. The proposed inter-cell signaling between HeNBs is independent of CC number, user number and CC allocation results in HeNB network, thus the inter-cell signaling overhead can be greatly reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed CC selection scheme can autonomously achieve high cell-average and cell-edge throughput. This distributed and adaptive scheme performed locally at each HeNB is suitable for the uncoordinated HeNB deployment without centralized control unit.\n",

Over the past two decades, we have designed, built, worn, and tested many different embodiments of this device in the context of wearable computing, Incorporated into the Reality Mediator is an \"EyeTap\" system, which is a device that quantifies and resynthesizes light that would otherwise pass through one or both lenses of the eye(s) of a wearer. The functional principles of EyeTap devices are discussed, in detail. The EyeTap diverts into a spatial measurement system at least a portion of light that would otherwise pass through the center of projection of at least one lens of an eye of a wearer. The Reality Mediator has at least one mode of operation in which it reconstructs these rays of light, under the control of a wearable computer system. The computer system then uses new results in algebraic projective geometry and comparametric equations to perform head tracking, as well as to track motion of rigid planar patches present in the scene. We describe how our tracking algorithm allows an EyeTap to alter the light from a particular portion of the scene to give rise to a computer-controlled, selectively mediated reality. An important difference between mediated reality and augmented reality includes the ability to not just augment but also deliberately diminish or otherwise alter the visual perception of reality. For example, diminished reality allows additional information to be inserted without causing the user to experience information overload. Our tracking algorithm also takes into account the effects of automatic gain control, by performing motion estimation in both spatial as well as tonal motion coordinates.\n",

We present a method for embedding 802.16 packets into 802.11 broadcast packets and padding the 802.11 broadcast payload, so that the broadcasts are aligned to 802.16 TDMA frame boundaries. Our method requires only software changes on the nodes using 802.11a for mesh communications. This means that the mesh networks installed with 802.11a hardware today can be upgraded with a software patch to take advantage of 802.16 MCF and do not have to wait for hardware upgrades to 802.11s. We show that despite the addition of the padding, emulated 802.16 has bandwidths comparable to the bandwidth achievable with 802.16 hardware. The efficiency of the hybrid system is significantly higher than the efficiency of 802.11 based systems. The new system can also provide deterministic guarantees on link bandwidths since it takes advantage of scheduled wireless access with 802.16 MCF. We use ns2 simulations to show the improved efficiency and guaranteed link bandwidth of the 802.11 based hardware using the emulated 802.16 MCF.\n",

This methodology is applied to a video processing algorithm, the motion compensated frame rate conversion (MC-FRC). Previous work has shown that designing a specific instruction set can enhance the performance with a speed-up of more than 80 fold. The purpose of this work is to quantify the energy efficiency of the resulting accelerated processor. This efficiency is evaluated by estimating the power and energy consumption of the processor and of the ASIP when running the algorithm. The results obtained show that the ASIP is more energy efficient than the standard processor by a factor of at least 40. This paper describes the methodology used to compute the power and energy consumption and explains the results through a more detailed analysis of the power and energy consumption.\n",

Natural examples of contexts include the zip code, gender, or abstract \"intentions\" (such as researching a vacation) of the searcher. After introducing a natural probabilistic model for contextbased auctions, we provide several theoretical results, including the fact that under general circumstances, the overall social welfare of the advertisers and auctioneer together can only increase when moving from standard to context-based mechanisms. In contrast, we provide and discuss specific examples in which only one party (advertisers or auctioneer) benefits at the expense of the other in moving to context-based search.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper we present a new scheme for parallelization of the Successive Over-Relaxation method for solving the Poisson equation over a 3-D volume. Our new scheme is both simple and effective, outperforming the conventional Red-Black scheme by a factor of 16 on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 590 GPU, a factor of 11 on an NVIDIA GeForce TITAN Black GPU and a factor of 5 on an Intel Xeon Phi. The speed-up compared to the fully optimised reference implementation running on an Intel Xeon CPU is 16 times on the GTX 590, 22 times on the TITAN and 5 times on the Xeon Phi. We explain the rationale and the implementation in OpenCL and present the performance evaluation results.\n",

            "Abstract: Not only in aviation psychology, mode confusion is recognised as a significant safety concern. The notion is used intuitively in the pertinent literature, but with surprisingly different meanings. We present a rigorous way of modelling the human and the machine in a shared-control system. This enables us to propose a precise definition of \"mode\" and \"mode confusion\". In our modelling approach, we extend the commonly used distinction between the machine and the user's mental model of it by explicitly separating these and their safety-relevant abstractions. Furthermore, we show that distinguishing three different interfaces during the design phase reduces the potential for mode confusion. A result is a new classification of mode confusions by cause, leading to a number of design recommendations for shared-control systems which help to avoid mode confusion problems. A further result is a foundation for detecting mode confusion problems by model checking.\n",

            "Abstract: Digital control systems, like those controlling the functions of buildings or industrial processes, pose a number of special problems for good user interface design. The general problems of providing usability, common to all systems, include difficulty in accessing and applying principles of good design. In addition, digital control systems can have multiple users, with multiple roles, and each installation has different configurations of systems, controls, and user interface devices. Providing interactions for the users of building control systems is often achieved by manually implementing each required display. This is an expensive solution, which often produces less than optimal results. We address these problems through the automation of user interface design. Our solution, called DIGBE (dynamic interface generation for building environments), separates the domain knowledge, interaction design, and presentation heuristics into multiple collaborating models. Each model contains knowledge about a particular aspect of interface design, and uses this knowledge to dynamically create each user interface that is needed to support the users of a control system. DIGBE demonstrates that it is possible to automatically and dynamically create consistent and individualized user interfaces from model-based design knowledge.\n",

            "Abstract: Significant progress has been made within the last decade in motor cortical decoding that predicts movement behaviors from population neuronal activity in the motor cortex. A majority of these decoding methods have focused on estimating a subject's hand trajectory in a continuous movement. We recently proposed a time identification decoding approach and showed that if a stereotyped movement is well represented by a sequence of targets (or landmarks), then the main structure of the movement can be reconstructed by detecting the reaching times at those targets. Both trajectory decoding and landmark-time decoding have their particular advantages, whereas a coupling of these two different strategies has not been examined. In this article we propose a synergy that comes from combining these two approaches for a stereotyped movement under a linear state-space framework. We develop a new decoding procedure based on a forward-backward propagation where the target is used in the initial stage in the backward step. Experimental results show that the new method significantly improves decoding accuracy over the non-target-included models. Furthermore, the coupling based on the new target-included method effectively combines the time decoding and trajectory decoding and further improves the decoding accuracy.\n",

            "Abstract: Phylogenetic inference is considered a grand challenge in Bioinformatics due to its immense computational requirements. The increasing popularity and availability of large multi-gene alignments as well as comprehensive datasets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in current biological studies, coupled with rapid accumulation of sequence data in general, pose new challenges for high performance computing. By example of RAxML, which is currently among the fastest and most accurate programs for phylogenetic inference under the Maximum Likelihood (ML) criterion, we demonstrate how the phylogenetic ML function can be efficiently scaled to current supercomputer architectures like the IBM BlueGene/L (BG/L) and SGI Altix. This is achieved by simultaneous exploitation of coarse- and fine-grained parallelism which is inherent to every ML-based biological analysis. Performance is assessed using datasets consisting of 270 sequences and 566,470 base pairs (haplotype map dataset), and 2,182 sequences and 51,089 base pairs, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest datasets analyzed under ML to date. Experimental results indicate that the fine-grained parallelization scales well up to 1,024 processors. Moreover, a larger number of processors can be efficiently exploited by a combination of coarse- and fine-grained parallelism. We also demonstrate that our parallelization scales equally well on an AMD Opteron cluster with a less favorable network latency to processor speed ratio. Finally, we underline the practical relevance of our approach by including a biological discussion of the results from the haplotype map dataset analysis, which revealed novel biological insights via phylogenetic inference.\n",

The switch consists of a novel copy network followed by a routing network which ensures sequencing. Both the copy and routing networks are based on deflection routing. The switch requires O(log N) stages and can be designed for any arbitrarily low level of packet loss. Switching elements in both the copying and routing networks have O(1) bit complexity, making the overall bit level hardware complexity of the network O(N log N). The latency of the switch is proportional to the number of stages O(log N). Unlike other existing copy networks, our copy network drops packets in a fair manner and hence can provide QoS support. The switch is output queued and allows the delivery of multiple packets to the same destination during a time slot.\n",

            "Abstract: While considerable technical ingenuity is being devoted to making the computer “disappear”, comparatively few research endeavours have concertedly explored the issues which arise when innovative artefacts are deployed in public settings. Innovations in “mixed reality”, “augmented reality” and “ubiquitous computing” tend to be confined to demonstrations, circumscribed trials or other controlled settings. However, a number of projects have begun to devote themselves to putting such technologies into the hands of the public and reflecting on the design and development issues that are encountered as a result. In particular, the SHAPE project was concerned with deploying innovative technologies in public settings, most notably museums. Over the course of our research, we developed an orientation to design which combines social scientific study, close collaboration with museum personnel and visitors, and a characteristic approach for technology deployment. In this chapter, we describe this orientation, exemplify it through accounts of the exhibitions the project has built at a number of museums in different European countries, and assess its broader implications for research on human-computer interaction, ubiquitous computing, and allied concerns.\n",

            "Abstract: Joint power control and beamforming schemes are proposed for cellular systems where adaptive arrays are used only at base stations. In the uplink, mobile power and receiver diversity combining vectors at the base stations are calculated jointly. The mobile transmitted power is minimized, while the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) at each link is maintained above a threshold. A transmit diversity scheme for the downlink is also proposed where the transmit weight vectors and downlink power allocations are jointly calculated such that the SINR at each mobile is above a target value. The proposed algorithm achieves a feasible solution for the downlink if there is one and minimizes the total transmitted power in the network. In a reciprocal network it can be implemented in a decentralized system, and it does not require global channel response measurements. In a nonreciprocal network, where the uplink and downlink channel responses are different, the proposed transmit beamforming algorithm needs to be implemented in a centralized system, and it requires a knowledge of the downlink channel responses. The performances of these algorithms are compared with previously proposed algorithms through numerical studies.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we study the theoretical problem of the end-to-end rate assignment for multi-hop wireless networks. Specifically, we consider the problem of joint congestion control, random access and power control design with multi-hop transmissions and interference-limited link rates. In order to address both the end-to-end throughput maximization and energy efficiency, we formulate this problem into a cross-layer design problem under a realistic interference-based communication model, which captures the attainable link capacity in practice. There are primarily three challenges in this design: 1) how to formulate the cross-layer design; 2) how to solve the non- convex and non-separable problem efficiently; more importantly 3) under a reasonably complexity, how to design a distributed algorithm that can realize this formulation while maintaining the architectural modularity among different layers. First, we propose a novel method that can convert a non- convex and non-separable programming into an equivalent convex programming problem. The problem is solved by a dual decomposition technique. We show that the resulting algorithm can be practically realized. We then design a distributed algorithm that jointly considers random access and power control to adapt for the transport layer congestion status. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm can achieve close to the global optimum within reasonable convergence times.\n",

This expansion allowed DCE to change its previous policy of restricting computer services to a small percentage of students to its current policy of extending these services to all DCE students.This flexibility enabled DCE's Institute for English Language (IEL) to change its previous position of assuming that all students did not have access to computer technology to its new position of assuming all students have access to computer technology. This new position has expanded the way IEL courses can be taught and managed. Church Street Staff initiated the building of relationships with IEL instructors to empower them with the skills and knowledge to infuse more technology into their courses.Church Street Staff organized and hosted a colloquium for IEL instructors in which they showcased services focused on a Harvard-developed instructional development Instructor's Toolkit. Main contacts for future support constituted the colloquium organization team. Team members conducted various parts of the colloquium to begin the process of building relationships with the instructors.The lab staff arranged bi-monthly follow-up training in the Instructor's Toolkit to a targeted cohort of IEL instructors. These instructors would then serve as peer mentors to their colleagues. The bi-monthly training culminated in a launch week in which the lab staff focused their attention on one-on-one help for the IEL instructors to launch their course websites.The success of the campaign was determined by the percentage of full-time instructors using email, website, bulletin board, and announcement tool as management and pedagogical tools complementing the classroom instruction.\n",

Terwiesch. 2002. Managing demand and sales dynamics in new product diffusion under supply constraint. Management Sci.48(2) 187--206) show that it is never optimal to refuse to satisfy any customers when the firm has inventory of the product. On the other hand, in a very similar model, Kumar and Swaminathan (Kumar, S., J. M. Swaminathan. 2003. Diffusion of innovations under supply constraints. Oper. Res.51(6) 866--879) show that production constraints may in fact lead a firm to reject customers' orders even when the firm has the inventory to satisfy them (to slow down new product diffusion). We provide a counterexample to the results of Ho et al. (2002) and show that in their and Kumar and Swaminathan's (2003) models, it may be optimal to deny customers a product in inventory. We provide a generalization of both models that includes the ability to dynamically price the product (and also allows capacity and production costs to vary over time). We show that the unintuitive but optimal behavior of denying customers products that are in inventory disappears when the firm can dynamically set prices.#R##N##R##N#This paper was accepted by Candace A.

            "Abstract: We present fast methods for separating the direct and global illumination components of a scene measured by a camera and illuminated by a light source. In theory, the separation can be done with just two images taken with a high frequency binary illumination pattern and its complement. In practice, a larger number of images are used to overcome the optical and resolution limitations of the camera and the source. The approach does not require the material properties of objects and media in the scene to be known. However, we require that the illumination frequency is high enough to adequately sample the global components received by scene points. We present separation results for scenes that include complex interreflections, subsurface scattering and volumetric scattering. Several variants of the separation approach are also described. When a sinusoidal illumination pattern is used with different phase shifts, the separation can be done using just three images. When the computed images are of lower resolution than the source and the camera, smoothness constraints are used to perform the separation using a single image. Finally, in the case of a static scene that is lit by a simple point source, such as the sun, a moving occluder and a video camera can be used to do the separation. We also show several simple examples of how novel images of a scene can be computed from the separation results.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we study the translational and rotational (SE(N)) invariance properties of locally interacting multi-agent systems. We focus on a class of networked systems, in which the agents have local pairwise interactions, and the overall effect of the interaction on each agent is the sum of the interactions with other agents. We show that such systems are SE(N)-invariant if and only if they have a special, quasi-linear form. The SE(N)-invariance property, sometimes referred to as “left invariance”, is central to a large class of kinematic and robotic systems. When satisfied, it ensures independence to global reference frames. In an alternate interpretation, it allows for integration of dynamics and computation of control laws in the agents' own reference frames. Such a property is essential in a large spectrum of applications, e.g., navigation in GPS-denied environments. Because of the simplicity of the quasi-linear form, this result can impact ongoing research on design of local interaction laws. It also gives a quick test to check if a given networked system is SE(N)-invariant.\n",

Our model applies the graph-theoretic approach, dealing with a lot of characteristics of OO paradigm. In addition, individual metrics for communication cost, concurrency and load balance are defined. Our allocation algorithm is based on the Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm (NPGA). The reason for using this technique is that a partitioning/allocation problem is multiobjective problem with non-commensurable (measured in different unit) objectives, and NPGA was proved to be effective in this kind of problem. We validated our model and algorithm by experimenting on the three typical OO systems in CORBA-based distributed environments. The main advantage of this approach is that the algorithm produces not a single solution, but a family of solutions known as the Pareto-optimal set, out of which the developer can select an optimal solution appropriate for his or her environmental conditions.\n",

In a set of existent schemes, this common shared secret is distributed as an arithmetic remainder embedded in a broadcast keying message, such that upon receiving the message, a legitimate recipient only needs to perform one modular operation upon the keying information to derive the secret. In this article, however, we point out a generic weakness in these protocols and demonstrate efficient methods for cryptanalysis. The presented approaches follow a collision attack paradigm and can work in a manner that even a completely passive outsider may somehow acquire the secret. Numerical analysis shows that in practical scenarios, our technique can compromise the common shared secret with a significant probability, implying that these broadcast encryption schemes are highly vulnerable.\n",

            "Abstract: It is observed that pulsed discharge currents allow to drain the battery with a higher specific power. Thus they improve the batteries durability and discharge performance. The question is how can the allowed discharge of a battery be modeled. Embedded real-time systems often rely on batteries. For these systems it is necessary to prove both, real-time feasibility and the constraint to not exceed the allowed discharge currents. This paper presents a unified approach for both objectives using the flexible model of event streams, because it allows both to model a complex allowed-discharge curve and the real-time requirements for complex task stimuli. We present the model and the calculation of the allowed and requested discharge curves. Together with the known event-stream based real-time feasibility analysis this allows a unified analysis of both aspects of the system. This work enables the modeling of complex discharge requirements of batteries for real-time systems.\n",

            "Abstract: We propose a low-complexity turbo space-time equalizer for signals transmitted over broadband wireless channels. The transmitter employs trellis coded modulation (TCM) for its bandwidth and power efficiency, and the broadband transmission is severely impaired by both intersymbol interference (ISI), due to multipath dispersion of the wireless channel, and cochannel interference (CCI), due to the presence of adjacent users. The proposed turbo equalizer consists of a broadband beamformer, which performs soft interference cancellation and space-time minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalization, followed by a soft-in, soft-out (SISO) TCM decoder. A priori expected symbol values are used as soft inputs in the soft interference cancellation stage and then, after beamforming, the elements of the output sequence are mapped onto extrinsic log-likelihoods or probabilities using a Gaussian assumption. Because these two operations make the beamformer a SISO processor, the front-end of the space-time receiver is suitable for iterative processing. The proposed structure is implemented with small antenna arrays and simulated for turbo equalization of 8-PSK TCM signals, and simulation results indicate a relatively close performance to \"no interference\" bounds after only a small number of turbo iterations.\n",

We have employed a methodology akin to that for System-on-Chip microelectronics to design an integrated circuit instrument containing several \"intellectual property\" blocks that will enable convenient reuse of modules in future projects. The present system was optimized for low-power and included mixed-signal sensor circuits, a programmable digital system, a feedback clock control loop and RF circuits integrated on a 5 mm /spl times/ 5 mm silicon chip using a 0.6 /spl mu/m, 3.3 V CMOS process. Undesirable signal coupling between circuit components has been investigated and current injection into sensitive instrumentation nodes was minimized by careful floor-planning. The chip, the sensors, a magnetic induction-based transmitter and two silver oxide cells were packaged into a 36 mm /spl times/ 12 mm capsule format. A base station was built in order to retrieve the data from the microsystem in real-time. The base station was designed to be adaptive and timing tolerant since the microsystem design was simplified to reduce power consumption and size. The telemetry system was found to have a packet error rate of 10/sup -3/ using an asynchronous simplex link. Trials in animal carcasses were carried out to show that the transmitter was as effective as a conventional RF device whilst consuming less power.\n",

            "Abstract: As a redundancy resolution method, the conventional extended Jacobian method (EJM) has two problems: One is the algorithmic singularity, and the second is nonexistence of a sufficient condition. Their impact on the inverse kinematic performances are exemplified. To remedy the related problems, we propose the notion of solution characteristics. It is based on an analytic sufficient condition for the EJM. This serves to confirm the right direction of optimization in the EJM and to characterize the algorithmic singularity problem. The above local characterization of an optimal solution by solution characteristics is globally extended by the invariance of the solution characteristics of the EJM. Specifically the characteristic of a solution with the EJM is invariant before crossing an algorithmic singularity. The ideas in this article also have practical implications since the EJM can now be fully analyzed with the theoretical results. To demonstrate its exactness and usefulness, planar three degrees of freedom (DOF) and spatial 4-DOF regional redundant manipulators are analyzed using the proposed solution characteristics.\n",

In this paper, we propose a new (onchip) bus synthesis algorithm to minimize the total sum of (1) and (2) in the microarchitecture synthesis. Specifically, unlike the previous approaches in which (1) and (2) are minimized sequentially without any interaction between them, or only one of them is minimized, we, given a scheduled dataflow graph to be synthesized, minimize (1) and (2) simultaneously by formulating and solving the two important issues in an integrated fashion: binding data transfers to buses and determining a (physical) order of signal lines in each bus, both of which are the most critical factors that affect the results of (1) and (2). Experimental results on a number of benchmark problems show that the proposed integrated low-power bus synthesis algorithm reduces power consumption by 24.8%, 40.3% and 18.1% on average over those in (J. Chang et al, Proc. of DAC, 1995) (for minimizing (1) only), (Y. Shin et al, Proc. of DAC, 2001) (for (2) only) and (both references) (for (1) and then (2)), respectively.\n",

            "Abstract: The model checker Uppaal is used to formally model and analyze parts of Zeroconf, a protocol for dynamic configuration of IPv4 link-local addresses that has been defined in RFC 3927 of the IETF. Our goal has been to construct a model that (a) is easy to understand by engineers, (b) comes as close as possible to the informal text (for each transition in the model there should be a corresponding piece of text in the RFC), and (c) may serve as a basis for formal verification. Our modeling efforts revealed several errors (or at least ambiguities) in the RFC that no one else spotted before. We present two proofs of the mutual exclusion property for Zeroconf (for an arbitrary number of hosts and IP addresses): a manual, operational proof, and a proof that combines model checking with the application of a new abstraction relation that is compositional with respect to committed locations. The model checking problem has been solved using Uppaal and the abstractions have been checked by hand.\n",

            "Abstract: Traditional discrete-event simulations employ an inherently sequential algorithm. In practice, simulations of large systems are limited by this sequentiality, because only a modest number of events can be simulated. Distributed discrete-event simulation (carried out on a network of processors with asynchronous message-communicating capabilities) is proposed as an alternative; it may provide better performance by partitioning the simulation among the component processors. The basic distributed simulation scheme, which uses time encoding, is described. Its major shortcoming is a possibility of deadlock. Several techniques for deadlock avoidance and deadlock detection are suggested. The focus of this work is on the theory of distributed discrete-event simulation.\n",

First, a path planning method dealing with localization uncertainties is proposed, where the uncertainties in both position and orientation of a non-holonomic mobile robot are considered. The safety of this method is due to the mixing of the planning phase and the navigation phase using the same process of localization (the Kalman filter). Next, while previous works planned safe paths in the configuration space, we show that it is necessary to plan safe paths in an uncertain-configuration space. Then, we introduce the novel concept of \"towers of uncertainties\" and show the effectiveness of this concept with some examples.\n",

In contrast to the traditional minimum mean square error (MMSE) or zero- forcing (ZF) multiuser detection (MUD) technique, the proposed method exploits the specific characteristics of the individual users' channel matrix, instead of treating all the users' channels jointly. Furthermore, two different power allocation schemes are investigated in the context of the proposed structure. One of them was designed for achieving the maximum information rate, while the other for maintaining the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We demonstrate that the capacity of the proposed scheme using the maximum information rate based power allocation policy is higher than that of the classic ZF receiver for the UL.\n",

Our experiments suggest that while NAT hole punching techniques are relatively mature, they succeed only about 90% of the time and thus p2p games will inevitably need to employ NAT proxies to establish the remaining connections. We demonstrate with an implementation and a measurement study that using peers as NAT proxies is feasible for both UDP and TCP connections. We found that it is relatively easy to find peers capable of acting as proxies and that the performance achieved is comparable to that of server-based NAT proxies.\n",

            "Abstract: Despite the intuition that strongly held beliefs are particularly difficult to change, the data on error correction indicate that general information errors that people commit with a high degree of belief are especially easy to correct. This finding is called the hypercorrection effect. The hypothesis was tested that the reason for hypercorrection stems from enhanced attention and encoding that results from a metacognitive mismatch between the person's confidence in their responses and the true answer. This experiment, which is the first to use imaging to investigate the hypercorrection effect, provided support for this hypothesis, showing that both metacognitive mismatch conditions-that in which high confidence accompanies a wrong answer and that in which low confidence accompanies a correct answer-revealed anterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus activations. Only in the high confidence error condition, however, was an error that conflicted with the true answer mentally present. And only the high confidence error condition yielded activations in the right TPJ and the right dorsolateral pFC. These activations suggested that, during the correction process after error commission, people (1) were entertaining both the false belief as well as the true belief (as in theory of mind tasks, which also manifest the right TPJ activation) and (2) may have been suppressing the unwanted, incorrect information that they had, themselves, produced (as in think/no-think tasks, which also manifest dorsolateral pFC activation). These error-specific processes as well as enhanced attention because of metacognitive mismatch appear to be implicated.\n",

The key idea is toshow the system some example operations with data in-stances and let it infer the operations for the whole collec-tion of data objects in the data repositories. This problem ischallenging, because we allow data in the data repositoriesto be semistructured, and inferring (generalizing) the op-erations is a non-trivial task. We already found throughexperiments that even users without any knowledge ondatabase-related concepts(such as database schemas, SQL-style queries and path expressions) can construct fairlycomplex Web-sites from a collection of XML documentsand a relational database, by following their intuitions. Wethink our system is an example of how end users can beempowered by the semistructured data technologies the re-search community has been developing, because the Web-site construction process is realized by them.The demonstration is done with an implemented systemof our AQUA (Amalgamation of QUerying and Authoring)project[5] . The project started with a recognition that thewide acceptance of the world wide web is not only due toits easy way to access data but also to the simple mecha-nism that enables end users to publish their own, personalWeb contents[3]. Some of such personal Web sites are verydata-intensive: For example, movie enthusiasts manage alot of movie information, and researchers’ Web sites havetheir publications. (They are not necessarily computer sci-ence researchers.) While they write tons of HTML docu-ments, few of them use database management systems. Weattribute it to the following two causes: (1) For end users,incorporation of databases’ contents into Web sites is difﬁ-cult: They can use commercially available authoring toolswith drag-and-drop facilities todesign their sites. However,they are typically required to write queries in SQL, whichis a completely different framework from the page author-ing. (2) The nature of live information from the real world\n",

Descriptive and inferential statistical tools were utilized to analyze data collected on a sample size of 321 undergraduate teenage students whose selection were based on simple random sampling technique across three Higher Institutions of Learning which were the University of Ilorin, Kwara state University, and Al-Hikmah University respectively. Findings from the data analyses revealed uniformity in the usage patterns of teenagers in the use of their mobile devices. Significant positive relationships were also established between mobile addiction and socio-psychological dimensions such as loneliness, boredom, egoism, and self-independence at varying significant levels.\n",

            "Abstract: Segmentation of a 3D human body, is a very challenging problem in applications exploiting human scan data. To tackle this problem, the paper proposes a topological approach based on the discrete Reeb graph (DRG) which is an extension of the classical Reeb graph to handle unorganized clouds of 3D points. The essence of the approach concerns detecting critical nodes in the DRG, thereby permitting the extraction of branches that represent parts of the body. Because the human body shape representation is built upon global topological features that are preserved so long as the whole structure of the human body does not change, our approach is quite robust against noise, holes, irregular sampling, frame change and posture variation. Experimental results performed on real scan data demonstrate the validity of our method.\n",

            "Abstract: In the context of data-intensive embedded applications, there have been two complementary approaches to data locality problem: restructuring code and restructuring data layout. Conceivably, an integrated approach that combines these two can generate much better results than each individual approach. However, there is an inherent difficulty in optimizing both data layout and loop access pattern simultaneously under a unified setting. This difficulty occurs due to the fact that a given data structure can be accessed by different loop nests of the application, and each such loop nest can demand a different memory layout transformation for the said data structure. This results in a coupling problem, where the behaviors of two (or more) loop nests are coupled to each other as a result of data sharing between them. In this paper, we present a constraint network (CN) based formulation of the integrated loop-data optimization problem. We present two alternate solutions to the data locality problem with our CN based formulation and discuss the pros and cons of each scheme. The first solution is a pure backtracking based one, whereas the second one improves upon the first one by employing three additional optimizations, including backjumping.\n",

A social network is composed of communities of individuals or organizations that are connected by common interests. In the social network sites, a user can register other users as friends and enjoy communication. In such a scenario, often users face problems in finding their appropriate friends using typical friend-of-friend-recommendation methods. In this paper, we propose a friend-recommendation system based on cohesion. We analyze the cohesive subgroup on an augmented network formed by the physical connection network with the information of common interests and interactions. All the users in a cohesive subgroup should be friends to each other. We validated our idea on a small friend network.\n",

We believe that this view is too simple. Knowledge is inextricably bound up with human cognition, and the management of knowledge occurs within an intricately structured social context. We argue that it is essential for those designing knowledge management systems to consider the human and social factors at play in the production and use of knowledge. We review work—ranging from basic research to applied techniques—that emphasizes cognitive and social factors in knowledge management. We then describe two approaches to designing socially informed knowledge management systems, social computing and knowledge socialization.\n",

            "Abstract: Abstract#R##N##R##N#The Graphical Kernel System (GKS) is now registered as an ISO International Standard for computer graphics programming. One of the major innovations of the Standard is the bundled specification of aspects, a mechanism which gives the applications programmer the ability to tailor the appearance of a picture independently on each of the workstations on which it is displayed, using the capabilities of the workstations. GKS also incorporates the traditional method of individual specification of aspects in which each workstation does the best it can to represent global aspect values. In this paper a formal specification technique, the Vienna Development Method (VDM), is used to describe aspect specification. The GKS model of aspect specification is progressively constructed from simpler models. Properties of these simpler models are formulated and the specifications are proved to conform to these. The properties are then traced through the more complex models. The paper demonstrates the applicability of formal specification to the design of graphics software and the ability of formal techniques to catalyse the deeper understanding of designs.\n",

InSAR images from the different time intervals, reveal that the 10-km-wide caldera has been subsiding during the time of investigation. The pattern of subsidence does not following the pyroclastic flows from the last eruption of the caldera in 1931. The maximum subsidence is near the center of the caldera, with a rate of up to 13 mm/yr. Deformation outside the caldera is insignificant. Least squares inversion of the multitemporal deformation maps indicates that the subsidence rate has been relatively constant. Field observations have identified numerous fumaroles inside the caldera. In 1973, temperatures of 80/spl deg/ C were measured at a depth of 15 cm in loose volcanic rubble adjacent to the small cinder cone (about 1.5 km northeast of the vent of the 1931 eruption), whereas springs near a caldera lake had a temperature of 25/spl deg/ C in July 1993, Therefore, we suggest the observed subsidence at Aniakchak caldera is most likely caused by the reduction of pore fluid pressure of a hydrothermal system located a few kilometers beneath the caldera.\n",

            "Abstract: Every year forest fires cause severe financial losses in many countries of the world. Additionally, lives of humans as well as of countless animals are often lost. Due to global warming, the problem of wildfires is getting out of control; hence, the burning of thousands of hectares is obviously increasing. Most important, therefore, is the early detection of an emerging fire before its intensity becomes too high. More than ever, a need for early warning systems capable of detecting small fires from distances as large as possible exists. A look to nature shows that pyrophilous “fire beetles” of the genus Melanophila can be regarded as natural airborne fire detection systems because their larvae can only develop in the wood of fire-killed trees. There is evidence that Melanophila beetles can detect large fires from distances of more than 100 km by visual and infrared cues. In a biomimetic approach, a concept has been developed to use the surveying strategy of the “fire beetles” for the reliable detection of a smoke plume of a fire from large distances by means of a basal infrared emission zone. Future infrared sensors necessary for this ability are also inspired by the natural infrared receptors of Melanophila beetles.\n",

The approach is based on a quantitative semantic framework where programs are represented as linear operators over dioids. We provide abstraction techniques for such linear operators which make it feasible to compute safe over-approximations of the long-run cost of a program. A theorem is proved stating that such abstractions yield correct approximations of the program's long-run cost. These approximations are effectively computed as the eigenvalue of the matrix representation of the abstract semantics. The theoretical developments are illustrated on a concrete example taken from the analysis of the cache behaviour of a simple bytecode language.\n",

It is proposed that features extracted from breaths preceding an apnoea and hypopnoea could be used in neural networks for the prediction of these events. Four different predictive systems were created, processing the nasal airflow signal using epoching, the inspiratory peak and expiratory trough values, principal component analysis (PCA) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The neural networks were validated with naive data from six overnight polysomnographic records, resulting in 83.50% sensitivity and 90.50% specificity. Reliable prediction of apnoea and hypopnoea is possible using the epoched flow and EMD of breaths preceding the event.\n",

To this end, several groups have proposed methods to predict critical instructions. This paper presents a framework that allows us to directly measure the criticality of individual dynamic instructions. This allows us to (1) measure the accuracy of proposed critical path predictors, (2) quantify the amount of slack present in non-critical instructions, and (3) provide a new metric, called tautness, which ranks critical instructions by their dominance on the critical path. This research investigates methods for improving critical path predictor accuracy and studies the distribution of slack and tautness in programs. It shows that instruction criticality changes dynamically, and that criticality history patterns can be used to significantly improve predictor accuracy.\n",

We propose a deblurring method of a single-image where the blur kernel is directly estimated from highlight spots or streaks with high intensity value. These highlighted points can be represented by specular reflection of light that may appear in the eye, on a shiny surface, or in small light sources present in the image. In this work, we detect automatically these high-lighted points in a blurred image. Therefore, creating a map of highlight, which is used as a guide to extract automatically a single highlight from the blurred image. Due to its unique nature, it is demosntrated that the highlighted points are a good estimation of the blur kernel and a sharp image is restored using these kernel. The experimental results show the performance of this method in comparison to several other deblurring methods.\n",

            "Abstract: Road profiles are a major excitation to the chassis and the resulting loads drive vehicle designs. The physical resources needed to measure, record, analyze, and characterize an entire set of real, spectrally broad roads is often infeasible for simulation. This motivates the need for more accurate models for characterizing roads and for generating synthetic road profiles of a specific type. First order Markov Chain models using uniform sized bins to define the states have been previously proposed to characterize and synthetically generate road profiles. This method, however, was found to be unreliable when the number of states is increased to improve resolution. In an effort to solve this problem, this work develops a method by which states are defined using nonuniform sized, percentile-based bins which results in a more fully populated transition matrix. A statistical test is developed to quantify the confidence with which the estimated transition matrix represents the true underlying stochastic process. The order of the Markov Chain representation of the original and synthetic profiles is checked using a series of preexisting likelihood ratio criteria. This method is demonstrated on data obtained at the Virginia Tech VTTI location and shows a considerable improvement in the estimation of the transition properties of the stochastic process. This is evidenced in the subsequent generation of synthetic profiles.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical intelligent decoupling control method for the gas collection process of three asymmetric coke ovens of an iron and steel company. The process features strong asymmetric coupling, large disturbances, and strong nonlinearity. These characteristics are exploited in the following steps to implement intelligent decoupling control. First, three fuzzy expert controllers and two feedforward controllers stabilize the pressure of each gas collector. Then, the three collectors are divided into two groups based on an analysis of the couplings among them to facilitate decoupling control. An intelligent decoupling control method is used to design intragroup and intergroup decoupling controllers. Finally, expert valve control handles the nonlinearity of butterfly valves, and a multirate sampling strategy further improves the control performance. The results of actual runs show that the system satisfactorily performs the intelligent decoupling control of the gas pressures of the coke ovens, sufficiently suppresses disturbances, and accurately stabilizes the pressures.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel data-embedding system with high embedding capacity. The embedding algorithm is based on the quantized projection embedding method with some enhancement to achieve high embedding rates. In particular, our system uses a random permutation of the columns of a Hadamard matrix as projection vectors and a fixed perceptual mask based on the JPEG default quantization table for the quantization step design. As a result, the data-embedding system achieves 1/167 (1 bit out of 167 raw image bits) to 1/84 hiding ratios with a BER of around 0.1% in the presence of JPEG compression attacks, while maintaining visual distortion at a minimum.\n",

The new prime/FH-CDMA scheme supports higher data rate than the conventional M-ary frequency-shift-keying FH-CDMA (MFSK/FH-CDMA) scheme, at the expense of worsening cross-correlation values. The performance and normalized spectral efficiency of both schemes are analyzed and compared. Our results show that the prime/FH-CDMA scheme, in general, utilizes similar system efficiency as the MFSK/FH-CDMA scheme and that both schemes provide a trade-off between data rate and performance.\n",

A classi£cation system that automatically identi£es the individual beat boxing sounds and can map them to corresponding drum sounds has been developed.

            "Abstract: Four subjectsecology, applied mathematics, sociology, and economicswere selected to assess whether there is a citation advantage between journal articles that have an open-access (OA) version on the Internet compared to those articles that are exclusively toll access (TA). Citations were counted using the Web of Science, and the OA status of articles was determined by searching OAIster, OpenDOAR, Google, and Google Scholar. Of a sample of 4,633 articles examined, 2,280 (49%) were OA and had a mean citation count of 9.04 whereas the mean for TA articles was 5.76. There appears to be a clear citation advantage for those articles that are OA as opposed to those that are TA. This advantage, however, varies between disciplines, with sociology having the highest citation advantage, but the lowest number of OA articles, from the sample taken, and ecology having the highest individual citation count for OA articles, but the smallest citation advantage. Tests of correlation or association between OA status and a number of variables were generally found to weak or inconsistent. The cause of this citation advantage has not been determined. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

            "Abstract: Understanding human behavior in video data is essential in numerous applications including surveillance, video annotation/retrieval, and human-computer interfaces. This paper describes a framework for recognizing human actions and interactions in video by using three levels of abstraction. At low level, the poses of individual body parts including head, torso, arms and legs are recognized using individual Bayesian networks (BNs), which are then integrated to obtain an overall body pose. At mid level, the actions of a single person are modeled using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) with temporal links between identical states of the Bayesian network at time t and t+1. At high level, the results of mid-level descriptions for each person are juxtaposed along a common time line to identify an interaction between two persons. The linguistic 'verb argument structure' is used to represent human action in terms of   triplets. Spatial and temporal constraints are used for a decision tree to recognize specific interactions. A meaningful semantic description in terms of subject-verb-object is obtained. Our method provides a user-friendly natural-language description of several human interactions, and correctly describes positive, neutral, and negative interactions occurring between two persons. Example sequences of real persons are presented to illustrate the paradigm.\n",

As the data is on the order of petabytes, current search engines are very large centralized systems based on replicated clusters. Web data, however, is always evolving. The number of Web sites continues to grow rapidly and there are currently more than 20 billion indexed pages. In the near future, centralized systems are likely to become ineffective against such a load, thus suggesting the need of fully distributed search engines. Such engines need to achieve the following goals: high quality answers, fast response time, high query throughput, and scalability. In this paper we survey and organize recent research results, outlining the main challenges of designing a distributed Web retrieval system.\n",

In this paper, we incorporated the perceived motion energy (PME) model into the proposed MPEG-21 digital item adaptation framework for frame dropping in H.264 encoded video adaptation. There are two advantages of this work, one is the use of PME model to reduce the viewer's perceived motion jitter due to frame dropping to a minimum. The other is the adaptation nodes can easily apply frame dropping operations without knowledge of detailed encoding syntax of H.264 videos.\n",

If  T  is finitely axiomatizable, then there is a least number  μ  so that  T  can be axiomatized by  μ  equations. This  μ  can depend on the operation symbols that occur in  T . In the 1960s, Tarski and Green completely determined the values of  μ  for arbitrary equational theories of groups and of rings. While Tarski and Green announced the results of their collaboration in 1970, the only fuller publication of their work occurred as part of a seminar led by Tarski at Berkeley during the 1968–69 academic year.

            "Abstract: The demand for Internet access in vehicles has been growing. To access the Internet from vehicles, a wireless road- vehicle communication system is necessary. In conventional road-vehicle communication systems, user terminals in the vehicles have to directly connect to wireless access points (APs). However, the speed of vehicles is so fast that the channel condition between the terminals and the APs constantly changes due to changing path-loss and time-varying fading. In this paper, we used an inter-vehicle packet relay technique to improve channel quality in road-vehicle communication systems. If a terminal can send data via other vehicles moving at lower speed, the relative speed will decrease, which suppresses the dynamic range of path loss and deterioration by fading. We evaluated this method using numerical analysis to verify the availability of the method.\n",

We present a new metaheuristic based on nuclear fusion and fission of atoms. This metaheuristic, called fusion fission, is compared to other classical algorithms. First, we present spectral and multilevel algorithms which are used to solve partitioning problems. Secondly, we present two metaheuristics applied to partitioning problems: simulated annealing and ant colony algorithms. We show that fusion fission gives good results, compared to the other algorithms. We demonstrate on a problem of air traffic control that metaheuristics methods can give better results than specific methods.\n",

            "Abstract: In First Person Shooter (FPS) games the Round Trip Time (RTT), i.e., the sum of the network delay from client to server and the network delay from server to client, impacts the gamer's performance considerably. Game client software usually has a built-in process to measure this RTT (also referred to as ping time), and therefore gamers do not want to connect to servers with a long ping time. This paper develops a methodology to evaluate the ping time in a scenario where gamers access a common gaming server over an access network, consisting of a link per user that connects this user to a shared aggregation node that in turn is connected to the gaming server via a bottleneck link. First, a model for the traffic the users and the server generate, is proposed based on experimental results of previous papers. It turns out that the characteristics of the (downstream) traffic from server to clients differ substantially from the characteristics of the client-to-server (upstream) traffic. Then, two queuing models are developed (one for the upstream and one for the downstream direction) and combined such that a quantile of the RTT can be calculated given all traffic and network parameters (packet sizes, packet inter-arrival times, link rate, network load, ...). This methodology is subsequently used to assess the (quantile of the) RTT in a typical Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) access scenario. In particular, given the capacity dedicated to gaming traffic on the bottleneck link (between the aggregation node and gaming server), the number of gamers (or equivalently the gaming load the bottleneck link can support) is determined under the restriction that the quantile of the RTT should not exceed a predefined bound. It turns out that this tolerable load is surprisingly low in most circumstances. Finally, it is remarked that this conclusion depends to some extent on the details of the downstream traffic characteristics and that measurements reported in literature do not give conclusive evidence on the exact value of all parameters, such that, although the qualitative conclusion still remains valid, additional experiments could refine the detailed quantitative results.\n",

To speed up branching path queries, we introduce the notion of k-l-bisimilarity into M(k)-index and propose an adaptive structural index, MBF(k, l)-index, which supports branching paths with any complexity efficiently and inherits the advantage of avoiding over-refinement from M(k)-index. Our experiments have shown that the index performs more efficiently in terms of space consumption and query performance for branching or simple paths in comparison with the same kind of indexes.\n",

            "Abstract: Representations are at the heart of artificial intelligence (AI). This book is devoted to the problem of representation discovery: how can an intelligent system construct representations from its experience? Representation discovery re-parameterizes the state space - prior to the application of information retrieval, machine learning, or optimization techniques - facilitating later inference processes by constructing new task-specific bases adapted to the state space geometry. This book presents a general approach to representation discovery using the framework of harmonic analysis, in particular Fourier and wavelet analysis. Biometric compression methods, the compact disc, the computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanner in medicine, JPEG compression, and spectral analysis of time-series data are among the many applications of classical Fourier and wavelet analysis. A central goal of this book is to show that these analytical tools can be generalized from their usual setting in (infinite-dimensional) Euclidean spaces to discrete (finite-dimensional) spaces typically studied in many subfields of AI. Generalizing harmonic analysis to discrete spaces poses many challenges: a discrete representation of the space must be adaptively acquired; basis functions are not pre-defined, but rather must be constructed. Algorithms for efficiently computing and representing bases require dealing with the curse of dimensionality. However, the benefits can outweigh the costs, since the extracted basis functions outperform parametric bases as they often reflect the irregular shape of a particular state space. Case studies from computer graphics, information retrieval, machine learning, and state space planning are used to illustrate the benefits of the proposed framework, and the challenges that remain to be addressed. Representation discovery is an actively developing field, and the author hopes this book will encourage other researchers to explore this exciting area of research.

It is a very active market with a high level of competitiveness where modest companies, in terms of budget, must reach a balance between the resources they can apply and the economic investment in a given production. Consequently, the automation of manual design processes, which are normally highly time-consuming, has become a crucial research topic for 3D animation studios. The work we are describing here presents one of these automatic tools, specifically focused on the synchronization of the speech and the lip movement of the characters, a process that is called  lipsync  . We have developed a very robust and accurate speech recognition module that together with a knowledge-based system, autonomously provides lipsync results. Additionally, the system has been integrated in the production plan of a 3D animation company, leading to drastic operator time reductions.\n",

The event driven analog modeling approach uses the double precision data type wreal (supported by VerilogAMS), that enables analog accuracy in the digital simulation domain. It is therefore possible to separate high frequency signal paths in the frequency synthesizers from the analog domain, in order to archive higher simulation efficiency for fast verification purposes. The modeling approach and an investigation of the necessary accuracy requirements for the verification including phase noise performances of the analog frequency synthesizers is presented. The proposed approach is demonstrated on baseof a sub micron CMOS Fractional-N frequency synthesizer and compared with different traditional modeling approaches, like phase model and pure digital model. The paper concludes with a proposal of a verification approach for RF mixed signal systems.\n",

            "Abstract: We put forth the question of whether cryptography is fea- sible using streaming devices. We give constructions and prove lower bounds. In streaming cryptography (not to be confused with stream- ciphers) everything—the keys, the messages, and the seeds—are huge compared to the internal memory of the device. These streaming algo- rithms have small internal memory size and make a constant number of passes over big data maintained in a constant number of read/write external tapes. Typically, the internal memory size is O(log n )a nd we use 2 external tapes; whereas 1 tape is provably insufficient. In this set- ting we cannot compute instances of popular intractability assumptions. Nevertheless, we base cryptography on these assumptions by employing non-black-box techniques, and study its limitations. We introduce new techniques to obtain unconditional lower bounds showing that no super-linear stretch pseudorandom generator exists, and no Public Key Encryption (PKE) exists with private-keys of size sub- linear in the plaintext length. For possibility results, assuming the existence of one-way functions computable in NC 1 —e.g. factoring, lattice assumptions—we obtain streaming algorithms computing one-way functions and pseudorandom generators. Given the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption we con- struct PKE where both the encryption and decryption are streaming algorithms. The starting point of our work is the groundbreaking work of Applebaum-Ishai-Kushilevitz on Cryptography in NC 0 . In the end, our developments are technically orthogonal to their work; e.g. there is a PKE where the decryption is a streaming algorithm, whereas no PKE decryption can be in NC 0 .\n",

            "Abstract: The fact that the scheduling problem is NP-complete has motivated the development of many heuristic scheduling algorithms. These heuristic algorithms often neglect the stochastic nature of tasks' execution times. Contrary to existing heuristics, in this study, tasks' execution times are treated as random variables and the stochastic scheduling problem is formulated accordingly. Using this formulation, it is theoretically shown that current deterministic scheduling algorithms may perform poorly in a real computing environment. In order to support the theoretical foundations, a genetic algorithm based scheduling algorithm is devised to make scheduling decisions either stochastically or deterministically by changing only the fitness function of chromosomes. The simulation studies conducted show that deploying a stochastic scheduling algorithm instead of a deterministic one can improve the performance of meta-tasks in a heterogeneous distributed computing system.\n",

            "Abstract: Private attributes of Online Social Network (OSN) users can be inferred from other information (which is usually from users' friends and group information). To address this, social networking sites allow users to hide their friend lists and group lists, so that general public cannot see them. However, if a user doesn't make his friend list public, but his friends have public friend list where we can find him, we can do reverse lookup to extend the friend lists of the user. Furthermore, many social networks allow non-group members to list the members of public groups (e.g., Face book). These are strong violations of OSN users' privacy, and can be considered as privacy risks caused by the asymmetric configuration of settings in OSNs. In this paper we present the privacy risks due to the lack of symmetric configurations, which exist in most of the OSNs. To make our idea more clear, we propose a inference attack and show that it can be used to infer users' private information, even users already made their friend list private. We theoretically analyze the risk of proposed privacy issues, and evaluate the risk using experiments based on real-world OSN data. We show that it is not sufficient to only disable friend list and group list to guarantee privacy, and propose methods to mitigate these privacy issues.\n",

It is necessary to utilize scientific methods when deciding to make these complicated investments, which probably result in large financial losses. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) can be applied to produce a comprehensive analytic framework for solving the real estate investment decision-making problem. Based on this theory, considering the dependence and feedback relationship of indices, the ANP model is established for real estate investment decision-making under certain criteria. Furthermore, an example of actual investment project in Shanghai is provided to illustrate the proposed ANP model. In this case, several different schemes were analyzed under multiple criteria in order to achieve the best investment scheme. The results show that ANP model can reflect the actual situation of real estate investment schemes and help decision makers to choose the fittest scheme. ANP model is useful and feasible in real estate investment decision-making, especially applicable to complicated real estate projects.\n",

            "Abstract: Because of the exponential growth in worldwide information, companies have to deal with an ever growing amount of digital information. One of the most important challenges for data mining is quickly and correctly finding the relationship between data. The Apriori algorithm is the most popular technique in association rules mining; however, when applying this method, a database has to be scanned many times and many candidate itemsets are generated. Parallel computing is an effective strategy for accelerating the mining process. In this paper, the weighted distributed parallel apriori algorithm (WDPA) is presented as a solution to this problem. In the proposed method, metadata are stored in TID forms, thus only a single scan to the database is needed. The TID counts are also taken into consideration, and therefore better load-balancing as well as reducing idle time for processors can be achieved. According to the experimental results, WDPA outperforms other algorithms while having lower minimum support.\n",

            "Abstract: Models of swarming and modes of controlling them are numerous; however, to date swarm researchers have mostly ignored a fundamental problem that impedes scalable human interaction with large bio-inspired robot swarms, namely, how do you know what the swarm is doing if you can't observe every agent in the collective? We examine swarm models that exhibit multiple collective motion patterns from the same parameters. These multiple emergent behaviors provide increased expressivity, but at the cost of uncertainty about the swarm's actual behavior. Because bandwidth and time constraints limit the number of agents that can be observed in a swarm, it is desirable to be able to recognize and monitor the collective behavior of a swarm through limited samples from a small subset of agents. We present a novel framework for classifying the collective behavior of a bio-inspired robot swarm using locally-based approximations of a swarm's global features. We apply this framework to two bio-inspired models of swarming that exhibit a flock and torus behavior and a swarm, torus, and flock behavior, respectively. We present both a formal metric of expressivity and a classifier that leverages local agent-level features to accurately recognize these collective swarm behaviors while sampling from only a small number of agents.\n",

            "Abstract: Scene classification is a major open challenge in machine vision. Most solutions proposed so far such as those based on color histograms and local texture statistics cannot capture a scene's global configuration, which is critical in perceptual judgments of scene similarity. We present a novel approach, \"configural recognition\", for encoding scene class structure. The approach's main feature is its use of qualitative spatial and photometric relationships within and across regions in low resolution images. The emphasis on qualitative measures leads to enhanced generalization abilities and the use of low-resolution images renders the scheme computationally efficient. We present results on a large database of natural scenes. We also describe how qualitative scene concepts may be learned from examples.\n",

            "Abstract: We address the challenge of requirements engineer- ing for sociotechnical systems, wherein humans and organizations supported by technical artifacts such as software interact with one another. Traditional requirements models emphasize the goals of the stakeholders above their interactions. However, the participants in a sociotechnical system may not adopt the goals of the stakeholders involved in its specification. We motivate, Protos, a requirements engineering approach that gives prominence to the interactions of autonomous parties and specifies a sociotech- nical system in terms of its participants' social relationships, specifically, commitments. The participants can adopt any goal they like, a key basis for innovative behavior, as long as they interact according to the commitments. Protos describes an ab- stract requirements engineering process as a series of refinements that seek to satisfy stakeholder requirements by incrementally expanding a specification set and an assumption set, and reducing requirements until all requirements are accommodated. We demonstrate this process via the London Ambulance System described in the literature. Index Terms—Requirements, refinement, architecture, commit- ments, teams, protocols\n",

            "Abstract: In recent years, the Particle Swarm Optimization has rapidly gained increasing popularity and many variants and hybrid approaches have been proposed to improve it. In this paper, motivated by the behavior and the spatial characteristics of the social and cognitive experience of each particle in the swarm, we develop a hybrid framework that combines the Particle Swarm Optimization and the Differential Evolution algorithm. Particle Swarm Optimization has the tendency to distribute the best personal positions of the swarm particles near to the vicinity of problem's optima. In an attempt to efficiently guide the evolution and enhance the convergence, we evolve the personal experience or memory of the particles with the Differential Evolution algorithm, without destroying the search capabilities of the algorithm. The proposed framework can be applied to any Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm with minimal effort. To evaluate the performance and highlight the different aspects of the proposed framework, we initially incorporate six classic Differential Evolution mutation strategies in the canonical Particle Swarm Optimization, while afterwards we employ five state-of-the-art Particle Swarm Optimization variants and four popular Differential Evolution algorithms. Extensive experimental results on 25 high dimensional multimodal benchmark functions along with the corresponding statistical analysis, suggest that the hybrid variants are very promising and significantly improve the original algorithms in the majority of the studied cases.\n",

Finally, orthogonal directions in the design of geographic resources may affect the semantics of the data they contain and impair their integration.#R##N##R##N#With the proliferation of GIS data and resources over the Internet, there is an increasing demand for robust geospatial information services that allow federation/interoperation of massive repositories of heterogeneous spatial data and metadata.#R##N##R##N#The purpose of this paper is to show how mediation – a data integration technique – can help in building such a Web-based required geospatial service. This technique has been fully implemented in the context of a geographic mediation/wrapper system that provides an integrated view of the data together with a spatial query language. As a proof of concept, we deployed the service in building a prototype for an interoperability application involving several catalogues of satellite images.\n",

            "Abstract: The attempts to count the passing people by the image processing have been made some time ago. But the conventional methods could not count the passing people accurately unless there were very few of the passing people through the gate at one time. In this paper, we propose an automatic method of counting the passing people by using the mathed of the template matching process. In proposed method, the camera is hung from the ceiling of the gate and the optical axis of the camera is set up so that the passing people could be observed from just overhead. In this system arrangement, if there are crowd people in the gate, then the data of the passing people are not overlapped each other on the obtained images. In addition, by using the color CCD camera, the human region and road region on the obtained images are able to be segmented accurately. In this paper, we show some experimental results obtained by using a simple experimental system to verify effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",

Image tracking of a video image was the focus of a frequency domain based approach using two-dimensional Fourier transforms for image correlation. When tracking a moving object that varies in size over time, a technique to identify the position of a template image within the larger picture was used. This approach requires the dynamic resizing of the template image in the video as it grows and shrinks in size. This approach allows for accurate image placement and the subsequent path of the image through a video screen can be followed. The solution can be implemented to provide real time results to provide the path of the image tracked.\n",

            "Abstract: Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a powerful optimization technique that has been applied to solve a number of complex optimization problems. One such optimization problem is network topology design of distributed local area networks (DLANs). The problem requires simultaneous optimization of a number of objectives, such as monetary cost, average network delay, hop count between communicating nodes, and reliability under a set of constraints. This paper presents a multi-objective ant colony optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the DLAN topology design problem. The multi-objective aspect of the problem is handled by incorporating fuzzy logic in the ACO algorithm. The performance of fuzzy ACO is evaluated through comparison with a fuzzy simulated annealing algorithm. Empirical results suggest that the fuzzy ACO produces results of equal quality when compared with a fuzzy simulated annealing algorithm.\n",

            "Abstract: In a cognitive sensor network (CSN), selfish sensors can choose to conduct cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) or local spectrum sensing (LSS). CSS usually improves sensing performance at the price of delay and energy consumption. A selfish sensor only decides to conduct CSS if it is more profitable than performing LSS. A key issue is how to achieve a desired decision outcome that maximizes spectrum utilization under the requirement of self-interest maximization and primary user (PU) protection. To address this problem, we formulate the interactive deciding of sensors as a noncooperative game, and Nash equilibrium (NE) corresponds to a stable decision outcome that no sensor has an incentive to resist unilaterally. It is shown that the desired decision outcome can be obtained by solving a constrained nonlinear 0-1 programming problem. We derive the desired decision outcome for homogenous sensors, and then develop a sensor selection mechanism for heterogeneous sensors to achieve the desired decision outcome in a distributed fashion. The proposed mechanism is shown to have a relatively low complexity. Computer simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.\n",

            "Abstract: The successful implementation of speech processing systems in the real world depends on its ability to handle adverse acoustic conditions with undesirable factors such as room reverberation and background noise. In this study, an extension to the established multiple sensors degenerate unmixing estimation technique (MENUET) algorithm for blind source separation is proposed based on the fuzzy c-means clustering to yield improvements in separation ability for underdetermined situations using a nonlinear microphone array. However, rather than test the blind source separation ability solely on reverberant conditions, this paper extends this to include a variety of simulated and real-world noisy environments. Results reported encouraging separation ability and improved perceptual quality of the separated sources for such adverse conditions. Not only does this establish this proposed methodology as a credible improvement to the system, but also implies further applicability in areas such as noise suppression in adverse acoustic environments.\n",

            "Abstract: Multiple view 3D video reconstruction of actor performance captures a level-of-detail for body and clothing movement which is time-consuming to produce using existing animation tools. In this paper we present a framework for concatenative synthesis from multiple 3D video sequences according to user constraints on movement, position and timing. Multiple 3D video sequences of an actor performing different movements are automatically constructed into a surface motion graph which represents the possible transitions with similar shape and motion between sequences without unnatural movement artifacts. Shape similarity over an adaptive temporal window is used to identify transitions between 3D video sequences. Novel 3D video sequences are synthesized by finding the optimal path in the surface motion graph between user specified key-frames for control of movement, location and timing. The optimal path which satisfies the user constraints whilst minimizing the total transition cost between 3D video sequences is found using integer linear programming. Results demonstrate that this framework allows flexible production of novel 3D video sequences which preserve the detailed dynamics of the captured movement for an actress with loose clothing and long hair without visible artifacts.\n",

This holds true for large-scale cell- biological simulations, afield that has emerged as data and knowledge concerning these systems increases and biologists call for tools to guide wet-lab experimentation. A promising approach to exploit parallelism in this domain is the integration of spatial aspects, which are often crucial to a model's validity. We describe an optimistic, parallel and distributed variant of the Next-Subvolume Method (NSM), a method that augments the well-known Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) with spatial features.

            "Abstract: High-speed, locational, phone-to-phone (HLPP) games and apps constitute a provocative class of mobile apps that are currently unsupported on commodity mobile devices. This work looks at a key problem for enabling HLPP: a specific variant of the localization problem in which two phones estimate each other's relative positions in 3D space without infrastructure support. Moreover, position estimates should reflect changes due to the phones' possible mobility.   We present a solution for achieving high speed 3D continuous localization for phone-to-phone scenarios. Our basic approach uses acoustic cues based on time-of-arrival and power level. It assumes at least two microphones and one speaker per phone, which is common on new smartphones. Accelerometers and digital compasses assist in resolving ambiguous acoustic-only localization. Continuous localization is achieved with the aid of a loose time synchronization protocol and an extended Kalman filter. Experimental results across a range of motion paths show localization resolution to within 13.9 centimeters for 90% of estimates, and to within 4.9 centimeters for 50% of estimates when the phones are several meters apart.\n",

The model is based on the idea that the closer the query terms in a document are to each other the more relevant the document. Our model handles Boolean queries but, contrary to the traditional extensions of the basic Boolean information retrieval model, does not use a proximity operator explicitly. A single parameter makes it possible to control the proximity degree required. To improve our system we use a stemming algorithm before indexing, we take a specific influence function and we merge fuzzy proximity result lists built with different width of influence function. We explain how we construct the queries and report the results of our experiments in the ad-hoc monolingual French task of the CLEF 2006 evaluation campaign.\n",

            "Abstract: At present, governments in many countries are actively engaged in the development of electronic trading and certification standards to enable the smooth operation of export markets. Standards and their usability underpin confidence in the operations of markets and their effective functioning. In institutional markets, an important role for government agencies lies in developing the initial specifications for standards for interoperable systems. Once these specifications are accepted, governments can then facilitate the eventual diffusion of a standard to the B2B marketplace. Acceptance of an industry standard can determine demand, which defines the viability of that market. In this paper, we describe an initiative by a government agency, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), in developing EXDOC, a standard for export documentation and the role that AQIS played in its implementation and diffusion. Our case study illustrates a successfully facilitated B2G implementation. It demonstrates how a standard can be supported and promulgated for the effective functioning of markets in the transition from manual to online export documentation. Once the overarching specifications for related industries have been established and diffused by government, opportunities arise for private sector markets to develop across these industries. Government agencies can promote the effective operation of standards for electronic markets. The EXDOC implementation and its iterations provide an exemplar of active engagement in the development of electronic trading and certification standards for an institutional market. Its successful diffusion provides a model of the implementation process for other export sectors and agencies.\n",

            "Abstract: Radio-astronomical observations are increasingly contaminated by interference, and suppression techniques become essential. A powerful candidate for interference mitigation is adaptive spatial filtering. We study the effect of spatial filtering techniques on radio-astronomical imaging. Current deconvolution procedures, such as CLEAN, are shown to be unsuitable for spatially filtered data, and the necessary corrections are derived. To that end, we reformulate the imaging (deconvolution/calibration) process as a sequential estimation of the locations of astronomical sources. This not only leads to an extended CLEAN algorithm, but also the formulation allows the insertion of other array signal processing techniques for direction finding and gives estimates of the expected image quality and the amount of interference suppression that can be achieved. Finally, a maximum-likelihood (ML) procedure for the imaging is derived, and an approximate ML image formation technique is proposed to overcome the computational burden involved. Some of the effects of the new algorithms are shown in simulated images.\n",

This work verifies the channel analysis/synthesis design of STAR by illustrating its capability to extract accurately the channel parameters (time delays and drifts, carrier frequency offsets, Doppler spread, etc.) from measured data and to adapt online to their observed time evolution in real-world propagation conditions. We also verify the performance of STAR by comparing the results achieved with generic and measured channels for an average multipath power profile of [0,-4,-8] dB and a vehicular speed below 30 km/h. The results suggest that losses due to operations with real channels are only 1 dB in SNR and 20-30% in capacity with DBPSK and single transmit and receive antennas. The corresponding SNR threshold for operation with real channels is about 5 dB.\n",

Such functions are uniquely determined by their values at the so-called critical set of all binary n-tuples of Hamming weight $ \\geqq n - \\lfloor \\log _2 t \\rfloor - 1$. An algorithm is presented for interpolating any t-sparse function f, given the values of f at the critical set. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is proportional to n, t, and the size of the critical set. Then, the more general problem of approximating 1-sparse functions is considered, in which case the approximating function may differ from f at a fraction $\\varepsilon $ of the space $\\{ 0,1\\} ^n $.

Model checking is a powerful verification methodology based on state exploration.

Here we focus on consensus algorithms based on the Heard-Of model, a new computation model for distributed computing. By making use of the high abstraction level provided by this computation model and by devising a finite representation of unbounded timestamps, we develop a methodology for verifying consensus algorithms in every possible state by model checking.\n",

Such QoS is usually included in service level agreements (SLAs) and thus, SLA monitoring platforms have been developed supporting violation detection. However, just a few of them provide explanation of the violations caused by observed QoS at monitoring time, but not in an user-friendly format. Therefore, we propose a general monitoring and analysis conceptual reference model and we instantiated it with SALMonADA, a SBS that notifies the clients with violations and their causes in their own easy-to-understand specification terms. In addition, our platform performs an early analysis notification that avoids delays in the client notification time when a violation takes place. Moreover, we have implemented a web application as a SALMonADA client, to prove how it monitors, analyses and reports to their clients the service level fulfillment of real services subject to a SLA specified with WS--Agreement.\n",

Teamwork and soft skills are especially important in software engineering and computer programming, where projects are general too strenuous for individuals to accomplish and effective teamwork is vital for efficient completion of the projects. However, these soft skills, such as collaboration, communication ability, expressing power, speaking ability, socio-cultural, independent responsibilities and collision resolution, are just very difficult to teach and learn because of the students' passive role in traditional course.

            "Abstract: We analyse the problem of solving Boolean equation systems through the use of structure graphs. The latter are obtained through an elegant set of Plotkin-style deduction rules. Our main contribution is that we show that equation systems with bisimilar structure graphs have the same solution. We show that our work conservatively extends earlier work, conducted by Keiren and Willemse, in which dependency graphs were used to analyse a subclass of Boolean equation systems, viz., equation systems in standard recursive form. We illustrate our approach by a small example, demonstrating the effect of simplifying an equation system through minimisation of its structure graph.\n",

            "Abstract: Knowing the depth structure of the environment is crucial for moving animals in many behavioral contexts, such as collision avoidance, targeting objects, or spatial navigation. An important source of depth information is motion parallax. This powerful cue is generated on the eyes during translatory self-motion with the retinal images of nearby objects moving faster than those of distant ones. To investigate how the visual motion pathway represents motion-based depth information we analyzed its responses to image sequences recorded in natural cluttered environments with a wide range of depth structures. The analysis was done on the basis of an experimentally validated model of the visual motion pathway of insects, with its core elements being correlation-type elementary motion detectors (EMDs). It is the key result of our analysis that the absolute EMD responses, i.e., the motion energy profile, represent the contrast-weighted nearness of environmental structures during translatory self-motion at a roughly constant velocity. In other words, the output of the EMD array highlights contours of nearby objects. This conclusion is largely independent of the scale over which EMDs are spatially pooled and was corroborated by scrutinizing the motion energy profile after eliminating the depth structure from the natural image sequences. Hence, the well-established dependence of correlation-type EMDs on both velocity and textural properties of motion stimuli appears to be advantageous for representing behaviorally relevant information about the environment in a computationally parsimonious way.\n",

Moreover, the local uniqueness of the convergence solutions for the CSAREs is investigated. Finally, in order to overcome the computation of large- and sparse-matrix related to the Newton’s method, the fixed point algorithm and the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method are combined.\n",

While most previous approaches for studying conservation of patterns in networks are through the application of network alignment algorithms or the identification of network motifs, we show that it is possible to exhaustively enumerate all graphlet alignments, which consist of subgraphs from each network that share a common topology and contain homologous proteins at the same position in the topology. We show that our algorithm is able to cover significantly more proteins than previous network alignment algorithms while achieving comparable specificity and higher sensitivity with respect to functional enrichment.\n",

            "Abstract: A wireless sensor network consists of several sensor nodes strewn over a large geographic area and base station. Depending upon the routing model used data collected by the sensor node are routed through several hops of the network to the base station. Before a new node becomes operational the base station verifies its authenticity for security reasons. We call this phase as secure joining of a node. The process of secure joining can be as simple as allowing a new node to join by simply verifying its MAC-ID in plain text. However, this simple secure joining is prone to many attacks and therefore, not acceptable to many organizations requiring high grade of security. On the other hand stringent process of secure joining such as multi-level verification of authentication credentials in a secure channel comes with a cost in terms of energy consumption. In this paper we propose a stringent secure joining method which uses the concept of certificate less PKI and symmetric key and goes through multi-level authentication for prevention of flooding attack.\n",

The positioning accuracy achieved by any Real Time Localisation System (RTLS) is affected by various critical factors, such as the network infrastructure, the implemented positioning algorithms, the environment complexity, the dynamic changes that occur, the device diversity etc. The aim of the suggested methodology is to allow the evaluation of the expected accuracy of a deployed positioning system, under its actual operating conditions. The data collected by the binomial experiment is statistically processed, in order for the evaluator to calculate the strength of his evidence, and finally decide whether the declared accuracy can actually be met or not. The proposed approach, due to its robustness, can be of significant value in device diversity scenarios, organic and dynamic environments.\n",

            "Abstract: When managing the problem of new product development (NPD), a firm needs to cooperate with or compete with its strategic partners in a network to survive in the industry. This paper first discusses the critical success factors (CSF) of NPD in a network, and then simplifies 37 CSFs into 10 items within 3 groups by factor analysis and Delphi method. While analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is capable of dealing with the NPD managerial problems by generalizing subjective judgment of experts, it cannot deal with the inter-relationship among factors or the usually imprecise and vague human judgment. To compensate this deficiency, analytic network process (ANP) incorporated with sensitivity analysis, instead of the popular fuzzy AHP model, is proposed, and a firm can make a decisive evaluation by applying the model. However, developing new products with strategic partners in a network is positively associated with efficiency and effectiveness and negatively with innovation. In order to lead a firm to operate efficiently, effectively and innovatively, the product lifecycle management (PLM) including suitable knowledge management (KM) and process development management is advised for the execution of the selected NPD mix. Balanced scorecard (BSC) using ANP with sensitivity analysis is then suggested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure and models.\n",

In surveillance or homeland security most of the systems aiming to automatically detect abnormal situations are only based on visual clues while, in some situations, it may be easier to detect a given event using the audio information. This is in particular the case for the class of sounds considered in this paper, sounds produced by gun shots. The automatic shot detection system presented is based on a novelty detection approach which offers a solution to detect abnormality (abnormal audio events) in continuous audio recordings of public places. We specifically focus on the robustness of the detection against variable and adverse conditions and the reduction of the false rejection rate which is particularly important in surveillance applications. In particular, we take advantage of potential similarity between the acoustic signatures of the different types of weapons by building a hierarchical classification system\n",

            "Abstract: This paper proposes novel resource sharing schemes for differentiated services (DiffServ) networks, to achieve both high resource utilization and quality of service (QoS) guarantee. Service level agreements (SLAs) are negotiated at network boundaries and supported by path-oriented resource mapping within the network. The recently proposed SLA management scheme based on virtual partitioning (Bouillet  et al. , 2002) allows overloaded SLAs to exploit the spare capacity of underloaded SLAs for efficient resource utilization, however, at the the cost of possible SLA violation of the underloaders. In the bandwidth borrowing scheme proposed here, the dedicated bandwidth for underloaded SLAs is determined and adaptively adjusted at network boundaries according to the actual traffic load and QoS policies; the available spare capacity is then properly distributed to related links for lending to others. On the other hand, the traffic flows admitted with borrowed bandwidth are tagged and may be preempted later when the original bandwidth owner needs to claim back the resources. Through a detailed implementation design and extensive computer simulation results we show that, by bandwidth borrowing, both SLA compliance and high resource utilization can be achieved in various load conditions, with some side benefits such as call-level service differentiation, small admission overhead, and convenience for policy-based management. In addition, we propose a distributed bandwidth pushing scheme that can dynamically adjust the spare bandwidth distribution over the network. Combining bandwidth pushing with bandwidth borrowing, the resource utilization can be further improved.\n",

We calculate it using a parralel algorithm on a high performance computing cluster and in the final stage of the approach we use a novel feature selection algorithm to build a kernel machine.

            "Abstract: Growth in the use of complex, domain-specific information technology (IT) applications by professionals in a number of non-IT disciplines, such as anthropology, chemistry, and sociology, has led to a demand for second-level IT courses that teach students who are not computer science majors how IT can be used to solve complex problems in specific professional domains. The authors provide and assess a solution to this problem by developing and evaluating a course in which complex IT concepts and tools are taught from the perspective of different disciplines. The course presents IT concepts through case studies of complex and specialized IT systems that are used to solve problems in well-defined domains. In this paper, the underlying ideas and design of this course are described. A pilot implementation of the course, with case studies in anthropology, sociology, and chemistry, is analyzed, and its impact on a variety of student perceptions about IT is discussed. The anthropology case uses a geographic information system with simulation capabilities to examine the expansion of tropical forest farmers and the accompanying deforestation in Central Panama. The sociology case uses advanced features of Microsoft Excel to examine and evaluate possible explanations for the shifts in occupational distribution that have occurred in the United States between 1980 and 1990.

            "Abstract: Abstract#R##N##R##N#Fault-tolerant routing is a key issue in computer/communication networks. We say a network (graph) can tolerate / faulty nodes for a routing problem if after removing at most / arbitrary faulty nodes from the graph the routing paths exist for the routing problem. However, the bound / is usually a worst-case measure and it is of great interest to find the routing paths when more than / faulty nodes exist. Cluster fault-tolerant (CFT) routing was proposed as an approach for this purpose. In the CFT routing, we reduce the number of “faults” that a routing problem has to deal with using subgraphs to cover the faulty nodes. In particular, we consider the number and the size (diameter) of faulty subgraphs rather than the number of faulty nodes that a graph can tolerate. In this paper, we show that a subgraph of diameter 2 can be viewed as a single “fault” for the following routing problems in the star graph: Given a source node s and t target nodes t1, …, tk, find k node-disjoint paths from s to ti (1 ≤ i ≤ k), and given k node pairs (s1, t1), …, (sk, tk), find k node-disjoint paths si ti (1 ≤ i ≤ k). Since a subgraph of diameter 2 of the n-dimensional star graph Gn may have n nodes, the above result implies that the number of faulty nodes that Gn can tolerate is n times larger than the worst-case measure if the faulty nodes can be covered by certain subgraphs. We also give algorithms which find the paths for the two routing problems. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n",

            "Abstract: Map generalization leads to simplified maps that are needed for specific applications. However, in the map generalization process [18], the processing of the map objects and the operations applied to achieve this simplified map are usually lost. This is due to the transaction processing systems implemented in commercial GIS systems. In this research, we used the Voronoi spatial data model for map generalizations. We were able to demonstrate that the map generalization does not affect only spatial objects (points, lines or polygons), but also the events corresponding to the creation and modification of map objects, together with their temporal and spatial adjacency relationships. In this paper, we present new solutions to the problems of spatio-temporal generalizations using the hierarchical Voronoi spatio-temporal data structure. The application of the hierarchical Voronoi data structure presented in this research is in spatio-temporal map generalization, which is needed for reasoning about dynamic aspects of the world, primarily about actions, events and processes. This provides an advance in the domain of map generalization as we are able to deal not only with the cartographic objects, but also their spatio-temporal characteristics and their dynamic behaviour.\n",

            "Abstract: A subspace-based method for detection of spread-spectrum signals is described in this paper that is similar to superresolution algorithms such as MUSIC. Sample vectors of despread symbol data are collected over time to form a correlation matrix, which is decomposed using Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD). When using linear phase modulation, the despread symbol data contains multipath peaks that are due to a number of physical paths which dominate the channel impulse response. In some cases, however, multipath gains have some substantial amount of correlation, indicating that a method of decorrelation prior to combining would be beneficial. Bit error rate curves show that the performance of this method has some advantage over a simple RAKE receiver at low fading rates. However, EVD-based algorithms are computationally complex compared to the RAKE receiver. By implementing the EVD-based orthogonal diversity-combining detector for phase modulated signals on an Intel Pentium 4, it is shown in this paper that the update rate for this algorithm on a modern (1.1 GHz PIV) processor is sufficient for real-time operation.\n",

For example, in the context of computer networks, one might want to generate lists of nodes ranked according to their susceptibility to attack. In addition, real-world data streams often exhibit concept drift, making the learning task even more challenging. We present an online learning approach to ranking with concept drift, using weighted majority techniques. By continuously modeling different snapshots of the data and tuning our measure of belief in these models over time, we capture changes in the underlying concept and adapt our predictions accordingly. We measure the performance of our algorithm on real electricity data as well as asynthetic data stream, and demonstrate that our approach to ranking from stream data outperforms previously known batch-learning methods and other online methods that do not account for concept drift.\n",

            "Abstract: It is well known that even under identical task conditions, there is a tremendous amount of trial-to-trial variability in both brain activity and behavioral output. Thus far the vast majority of event-related potential (ERP) studies investigating the relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in brain activity and behavioral performance have only tested a monotonic relationship between them. However, it was recently found that across-trial variability can correlate with behavioral performance independent of trial-averaged activity. This finding predicts a U- or inverted-U- shaped relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral output, depending on whether larger brain variability is associated with better or worse behavior, respectively. Using a visual stimulus detection task, we provide evidence from human electrocorticography (ECoG) for an inverted-U brain-behavior relationship: When the raw fluctuation in broadband ECoG activity is closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate is higher and reaction times faster. Importantly, we show that this relationship is present not only in the post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity, but also in the pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting anticipatory brain dynamics. Our findings are consistent with the presence of stochastic noise in the brain. They further support attractor network theories, which postulate that the brain settles into a more confined state space under task performance, and proximity to the targeted trajectory is associated with better performance.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging task of simultaneous recognition of overlapping sound events from single channel audio. Conventional frame-based methods aren’t well suited to the problem, as each time frame contains a mixture of information from multiple sources. Missing feature masks are able to improve the recognition in such cases, but are limited by the accuracy of the mask, which is a non-trivial problem. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Local Spectrogram Features (LSFs) which represent local spectral information that is extracted from the two-dimensional region surrounding “keypoints” detected in the spectrogram. The keypoints are designed to locate the sparse, discriminative peaks in the spectrogram, such that we can model sound events through a set of representative LSF clusters and their occurrences in the spectrogram. To recognise overlapping sound events, we use a Generalised Hough Transform (GHT) voting system, which sums the information over many independent keypoints to produce onset hypotheses, that can detect any arbitrary combination of sound events in the spectrogram. Each hypothesis is then scored against the class distribution models to recognise the existence of the sound in the spectrogram. Experiments on a set of five overlapping sound events, in the presence of non-stationary background noise, demonstrates the potential of our approach.\n",

            "Abstract: The SMOS(Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) Mission was selected in May 1999 by the European Space Agency to provide global and frequent soil moisture and sea surface salinity maps. SMOS' single payload is MIRAS(Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis), an L-band 2D aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer with multiangular observation capabilities. To achieve the ultimate goal of 0.1 psu error in ocean salinity retrievals, most studies assume the independence of measurements both in time and space so that the standard deviation of the retrieval errors decreases with the inverse of square root of the number of measurements being averaged. However, biases in the brightness temperature images originated from errors in the noise injection radiometers. Sun contributions to the antenna temperature, and imaging under aliasing conditions need to be compensated before attempting to retrieve the sea surface salinity. This work presents an external calibration suitable to perform salinity retrievals with an acceptable error. This study has been performed using the SMOS End-to-end Performance Simulator(SEPS) including thermal noise, all instrumental error sources, current error-correction and image reconstruction algorithms, and correction of atmospheric and sky noises.

            "Abstract: Unmanned air vehicles (UAV's) are seeing increased use in many applications. One common problem is keeping a target or region in the view of a camera mounted on an UAV. Keeping multiple targets in view compounds the problem. For a fixed wing UAV, this is further complicated by the forward velocity constraints of the system. This paper presents an initial investigation into such to solve this problem with motion planning algorithms. We propose to search through the space of elliptical orbits that to find one that best keeps multiple targets in view. The search is performed using rapidly expanding trees in the space of possible ellipses. The choice of ellipse is predicated on a pair of cost functions based on the mean and variance of the targets' locations in the camera image. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the ability successfully find an ellipse.\n",

            "Abstract: Feedback based on automatic assessment of students' solutions is an important aid for students' learning process in self-study and distance learning. Most automatic assessment systems allow students to revise their solutions after getting the feedback and resubmit their work to be able to complete the exercise. In this paper, we analyze the effect of re submission in detail in the context of automatically assessed algorithm simulation exercises. In the target system TRAKLA2, students can revise their answers as many times as they wish, but each trial requires to restart the exercise with new random data. We present statistical results from a course with 600 students and show that our method that combines resubmissions and exercises with randomized initial data has a positive effect on learning results.\n",

            "Abstract: Prompted by a recent question of Hjorth [G. Hjorth, An oscillation theorem for groups of isometries, manuscript] as to whether a bounded Urysohn space is indivisible, that is to say has the property that any partition into finitely many pieces has one piece which contains an isometric copy of the space, we answer this question and more generally investigate partitions of countable metric spaces. We show that an indivisible metric space must be bounded and totally Cantor disconnected, which implies in particular that every Urysohn space U\"V with V containing some dense initial segment of R\"+ is divisible. On the other hand we also show that one can remove ''large'' pieces from a bounded Urysohn space with the remainder still inducing a copy of this space, providing a certain ''measure'' of the indivisibility. Associated with every totally Cantor disconnected space is an ultrametric space, and we go on to characterize the countable ultrametric spaces which are homogeneous and indivisible.\n",

            "Abstract: Empirical analyses of complex games necessarily focus on a restricted set of strategies, and thus the value of empirical game models depends on effective methods for selectively exploring a space of strategies. We formulate an iterative framework for strategy exploration, and experimentally evaluate an array of generic exploration policies on three games: one infinite game with known analytic solution, and two relatively large empirical games generated by simulation. Policies based on iteratively finding a beneficial deviation or best response to the minimum-regret profile among previously explored strategies perform generally well on the profile-regret measure, although we find that some stochastic introduction of suboptimal responses can often lead to more effective exploration in early stages of the process. A novel formation-based policy performs well on all measures by producing low-regret approximate formations earlier than the deviation-based policies.\n",

This technical note tackles this problem for linear systems with constant time delays, and gives necessary and sufficient conditions to eliminate, whenever is possible, or to reduce the number of time delays and a constructive way to get the corresponding bicausal change of coordinates.\n",

            "Abstract: Non-conventional or advanced machining techniques are becoming the enabling fabrication techniques for many emerging fields including Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or Microsystems Technology (MST). The processes used for MEMS fabrication include standard semiconductor fabrication processes and emerging micromachining techniques. Among the challenges emerging from the manufacturing of MEMS devices, post-processing seems to be one of the most sensitive issues. The non-traditional common post-processing techniques are bulk micromachining and surface micromachining. It has been a challenge for MEMS designers to develop a micromachining technique that is compatible with IC (Integrated Circuits) processes and also capable of making MEMS structures through both bulk and surface micromachining with acceptable surface roughness requirements. The selected micromachining process should not affect the integrity of the free standing structure due to the reduced selectivity and aggressive etch of the adjacent electronic circuitry. Moreover, the integrity of the released structure, the dynamic properties as well as the electrostatic characteristics, are strongly dependent on the achieved roughness of the surfaces produced by the etching process. Hence, this paper presents the surface roughness characterisation of gas phase micromachining with XeF 2  that is suitable for fabricating integrated MEMS with both micromechanical and microelectronics components. This paper also presents some fabricated microsystems using this process.\n",

The set of edges that connect consecutively scheduled operations along with the nodes that correspond to the consecutively scheduled operations constitutes a worm. We propose an algorithm to construct a partitioning of a DAG into a collection of worms. This is done by finding the longest worm at the moment and maintaining the legality of worm partitioning. We characterize a legality of worm partitioning by introducing a simple set notation and proving its property. Based on that notation and its property, we prove that our algorithm correctly works. We also show that our algorithm works even in a DAG which contains interleaved sharing. Experimental results on several DAGS show that our technique generates worm partitioning of DAGs with small cardinality.\n",

            "Abstract: As confirmed by recent neurophysiological studies, the use of dynamic information is extremely important for humans in visual perception of biological forms and motion. Apart from the mere computation of the visual motion of the viewed objects, the motion itself conveys far more information, which helps understanding the scene. This paper provides an overview and some new insights on the use of dynamic visual information for face recognition. In this context, not only physical features emerge in the face representation, but also behavioral features should be accounted. While physical features are obtained from the subject's face appearance, behavioral features are obtained from the individual motion and articulation of the face. In order to capture both the face appearance and the face dynamics, a dynamical face model based on a combination of Hidden Markov Models is presented. The number of states (or facial expressions) are automatically determined from the data by unsupervised clustering of expressions of faces in the video. The underlying architecture closely recalls the neural patterns activated in the perception of moving faces. Preliminary results on real video image data show the feasibility of the proposed approach.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach for reconstructing a closed continuous surface of an object from multiple calibrated color images and silhouettes. Any accurate reconstruction must satisfy (1) photo-consistency and (2) silhouette consistency constraints. Most existing techniques treat these cues identically in optimization frameworks where silhouette constraints are traded off against photo-consistency and smoothness priors. Our approach strictly enforces silhouette constraints, while optimizing photo-consistency and smoothness in a global graph-cut framework. We transform the reconstruction problem into computing max-flow/min-cut in a geometric graph, where any cut corresponds to a surface satisfying exact silhouette constraints (its silhouettes should exactly coincide with those of the visual hull); a minimum cut is the most photo-consistent surface amongst them. Our graph-cut formulation is based on the rim mesh, (the combinatorial arrangement of rims or contour generators from many views) which can be computed directly from the silhouettes. Unlike other methods, our approach enforces silhouette constraints without introducing a bias near the visual hull boundary and also recovers the rim curves. Results are presented for synthetic and real datasets.\n",

Is there a general method for handling uncertainty? Or, at least, are there rules that could in principle be followed by an ideally rational mind when discussing scientific matters? What makes one statement more plausible than another? How much more plausible? And then, when new information is acquired how do we change our minds? Or, to put it differently, are there rules for learning? Are there rules for processing information that are objective and consistent? Are they unique? And, come to think of it, what, after all, is information? It is clear that data contains or conveys information, but what does this precisely mean? Can information be conveyed in other ways? Is information physical? Can we measure amounts of information? Do we need to? Our goal is to develop the main tools for inductive inference--probability and entropy--from a thoroughly Bayesian point of view and to illustrate their use in physics with examples borrowed from the foundations of classical statistical physics.\n",

            "Abstract: Inductive coupling among stacked chips in a package enables 1.2 Gb/s/channel data communications. An array arrangement of the channel increases data bandwidth, while the signal may be degraded by cross talk. In this paper, cross talk is measured and analyzed, and cross talk countermeasures are discussed for the first time. Received signal waveforms by the inductive coupling are measured by embedded voltage detectors on a test chip. The interference-to-signal ratio (ISR) has good agreement between the measurements and calculations from a theoretical model. It is found that cross talk is reduced to being negligibly small at a certain distance. If the channels are arranged at intervals of this distance, ISR is minimized. A technique based on time division multiple access (TDMA) is also proposed to further reduce cross talk.\n",

            "Abstract: The recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies bring the potential of a better characterization of the genetic variation in humans and other organisms. In many occasions, either by design or by necessity, the sequencing procedure is performed on a pool of DNA samples with different abundances, where the abundance of each sample is unknown. Such a scenario is naturally occurring in the case of metagenomics analysis where a pool of bacteria is sequenced, or in the case of population studies involving DNA pools by design. Particularly, various pooling designs were recently suggested that can identify carriers of rare alleles in large cohorts, dramatically reducing the cost of such large-scale sequencing projects. A fundamental problem with such approaches for population studies is that the uncertainty of DNA proportions from different individuals in the pools might lead to spurious associations. Fortunately, it is often the case that the genotype data of at least some of the individuals in the pool is known. Here, we propose a method (eALPS) that uses the genotype data in conjunction with the pooled sequence data in order to accurately estimate the proportions of the samples in the pool, even in cases where not all individuals in the pool were genotyped (eALPS-LD). Using real data from a sequencing pooling study of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we demonstrate that the estimation of the proportions is crucial, since otherwise there is a risk for false discoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach is also applicable to the problem of quantification of species in metagenomics samples (eALPS-BCR) and is particularly suitable for metagenomic quantification of closely related species.\n",

            "Abstract: The traditional networking builds on layered protocol architecture to isolate the complexities in different layers. It has been realized that real-life wireless sensor networks (WSNs) must be considered holistically across different layers for optimum performance. We consider a special case of WSNs that is deployed in underground tunnels. Underground communications present unique signal propagation characteristics due to the geographic and geological features, which in turn impact the underground network deployment and multi-hop routing patterns. We propose an efficient routing algorithm, called BRIT (Bounce Routing in Tunnels), for underground WSNs, and evaluate BRIT against the bottom-line AODV in terms of network throughput, packet loss rate, stability and latency using simulations. The contributions of the paper include a hybrid signal propagation model in three-dimensional underground tunnels, an assortment of sensor deployment strategies in tunnels, an integrated routing metric (forwarding speed), and a route suppression mechanism.\n",

These impulses excite the natural frequencies of the system to resonate. The proposed algorithm uses wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) to localize the subband containing the frequencies of the system resonance. Decomposition of the vibration signal is performed only for the best wavelet packet tree, which results in lower computational complexity compared with other conventional methods. Moreover, reliable detection is achieved by utilizing de-noising techniques. Finally, studies on simulated and real vibration signals from defective bearings reveal that the proposed method effectively identifies the bearing faults even in case that the desired signal is buried in background noise.\n",

We analyze the desirable characteristics of the behavior profilers for multimedia consumer electronics systems and based on the analysis results we also implement a novel profiler tool set which consists of light-weight profiler components and remotely executed GUI client programs. The implemented profiler tool set is independent to the processor architecture and able to analyze the whole system layers from operating systems to functions inside user-level applications.

            "Abstract: The use case concept is a tool for capturing the requirements of a system. A single use case describes a subset of a system's functionality in terms of the interactions between the system and a set of users or actors. A use case is initiated by a particular user, and serves the purpose of delivering some meaningful unit of work, service, or value to the initiator. When capturing requirements, a use case views the system as a black box. Due to their popularity, the concept of use cases has been abused to some extent, and been applied to specifying the \"requirements\" of all sorts of things, such as those of a subsystem of the system architecture. Cockburn (1997) acknowledges 18 different definitions of use cases. This has created a great deal of confusion and a need for clear definitions. Just what is a \"use case\"? We seek to answer that question, by providing a specification of a use case and its related concepts using the Z formalism.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper analyzes two-tier orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing OFDM-based cellular structure, when the traditional macrocell structure is extended with femtocells. The benefit of using femtocells is the capacity and coverage extension capability. To fulfill strict quality of service requirements in next-generation mobile networks such as Long Term Evolution LTE or LTE-Advanced, capacity and coverage enhancing becomes rather important. On the other hand, adding small cells such as femtocells next to macrocell modifies the interference pattern of the current region. Therefore, the number of small cells in a given area should be limited. In this paper, we provide an analytic framework to calculate the outage probability for a macrocell user in OFDM-based femtocell networks when the deployed femto base stations are composing an independent Poisson cluster process such as Thomas cluster process. Cluster-based femtocell modeling offers accurate network planning for mobile operators. In this cluster-based realization, we give an interference characterization and consider the outage probability for a randomly deployed user when communication channel is infected with Rayleigh fading.

            "Abstract: An evolutionary approach has been proposed to improve Simplified Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network performance for off-line font-based recognition of printed Persian alphabetical characters. Some of Persian characters are so similar to each other. We have defined and used some fuzzy sets in feature extraction to improve recognition of these characters. Also, the presentation order of training patterns to a simplified fuzzy ARTMAP neural network affects the classification performance. The common method to solve this problem is to use several simulations with training patterns presented in random order, where voting strategy is used to compute the final performance. In this paper, a method based on Particle Swarm Optimization is proposed to obtain the presentation order of training Persian fonts for improving the performance of Simplified Fuzzy ARTMAP. This method uses generalization error as a criterion to specify the best order of training patterns in this problem. The new method has the advantage of improved classification performance compared to the random ordering.The achieved average recognition rates were 91.24% for twelve popular Persian fonts.\n",

            "Abstract: It is well known that fill insertion adversely affects total and coupling capacitance of interconnects. While grounded fill can be extracted by full-chip extractors, floating fill can be reliably extracted by 3D field solvers only. Due to poor understanding of the impact of floating fill on capacitance, designers insert floating fill conservatively. In this paper we study the impact of floating fill insertion on coupling and total capacitance when the fill geometry, and both the interconnects between which the capacitance is measured are on the same layer. We show that the capacitance with same-layer neighboring interconnects is a large fraction of total capacitance, and that it is significantly affected by fill geometries on the same layer. We analyze the effect of fill configuration parameters such as fill size, fill location, interconnect width, interconnect spacing, etc. and consider edge effects and effects occurring due to insertion of several fill geometries in close proximity. Based on our findings, we propose certain guidelines to achieve high metal density while having smaller impact on interconnect capacitance. Finally, we validate the proposed guidelines using representative process parameters and a 3D field solver. On average coupling capacitance increase due to floating-fill insertion decreases by /spl sim/ 53% on using the proposed guidelines.\n",

Each SU in cognitive relay networks can choose direct transmission or cooperative transmission with the help of relay nodes (RNs). The primary users (PUs) may lease the licensed spectrum for a fraction of time to SUs for some remuneration. So the SUs adopt time-division multiple-access (TDMA) to access the licensed spectrum. For energy efficiency, we jointly consider the time slot scheduling and transmission strategy selection (i.e. direct transmission or cooperative transmission) problem. Numerical results indicate that the transmission power consumption indeed decreases due to the cooperative diversity.\n",

            "Abstract: We propose a new test method for investigating which macroscopic continuum models, among the many existing models, give the best description of rarefied gas flows over a range of Knudsen numbers. The merits of our method are: no boundary conditions for the continuum models are needed, no coupled governing equations are solved, while the Knudsen layer is still considered. This distinguishes our proposed test method from other existing techniques (such as stability analysis in time and space, computations of sound speed and dispersion, and the shock wave structure problem). Our method relies on accurate, essentially noise-free, solutions of the basic microscopic kinetic equation, e.g. the Boltzmann equation or a kinetic model equation; in this paper, the BGK model and the ES-BGK model equations are considered.Our method is applied to test whether one-dimensional stationary Couette flow is accurately described by the following macroscopic transport models: the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, Burnett equations, Grad's 13 moment equations, and the regularized 13 moment equations (two types: the original, and that based on an order of magnitude approach). The gas molecular model is Maxwellian.For Knudsen numbers in the transition-continuum regime (Kn ≤ 0.1), we find that the two types of regularized 13 moment equations give similar results to each other, which are better than Grad's original 13 moment equations, which, in turn, give better results than the Burnett equations. The Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations give the worst results. This is as expected, considering the presumed accuracy of these models. For cases of higher Knudsen numbers, i.e. Kn > 0.1, all macroscopic continuum equations tested fail to describe the flows accurately. We also show that the above conclusions from our tests are general, and independent of the kinetic model used.\n",

            "Abstract: In May 2006, we published a special issue on Supply Chain Management: Technology, Globalization, and Policy at a Crossroads (Johnson 2006). The response was far greater than we could have ever hoped. When we published that special issue, we were still processing a number of papers that we could not include at that time. We now present two more papers from that stream of work. While both are interesting and relate to the special issue topic, they differ slightly from the typical Interfaces application article. They focus on very different aspects of globalization in the auto industry. Balakrishnan, Seshadri, Sheopuri, and Iyer examine the supply chain evolution in the Indian auto industry. They track the progress of the industry on dimensions of cost, quality, productivity, and profitability and compare them to the trajectories of the competitors in China. With the rapid rise of manufacturing in both India and China, the results provide an intriguing view into these changing supply chains. The second paper examines how product variety impacts supply chain design. While globalization is often accused of fostering product homogeneity, for individual manufacturers the challenge of serving global customers is more often related to the complexity of handling product variants. Over the past 10 years, operations researchers have examined many technical aspects of managing product variety. Swaminathan and Nitsch look at how global auto firms have managed variety and analyze a particular supply chain strategy called the sequencing point (SP). They classify and categorize different supply chain strategies for managing variety in the context of short case studies.\n",

            "Abstract: The work described is part of a long term program of introducing institutional robotics, a novel framework for the coordination of robot teams that stems from institutional economics concepts. Under the framework, institutions are cumulative sets of persistent artificial modifications made to the environment or to the internal mechanisms of a subset of agents, thought to be functional for the collective order. In this article we introduce a formal model of institutional controllers based on Petri nets. We define executable Petri nets-an extension of Petri nets that takes into account robot actions and sensing-to design, program, and execute institutional controllers. We use a generalized stochastic Petri net view of the robot team controlled by the institutional controllers to model and analyze the stochastic performance of the resulting distributed robotic system. The ability of our formalism to replicate results obtained using other approaches is assessed through realistic simulations of up to 40 e-puck robots. In particular, we model a robot swarm and its institutional controller with the goal of maintaining wireless connectivity, and successfully compare our model predictions and simulation results with previously reported results, obtained by using finite state automaton models and controllers.\n",

            "Abstract: Large scale systems such as the grid need scalable and efficient resource allocation mechanisms to fulfil the requirements of its participants and applications while the whole system is regulated to work efficiently. Economics inspired models have shown ability to handle efficiently the allocation of resources and services, scaling up well as they are decentralized. Our model considers the arbitration of decisions at the local scope and short term, the regulation of the system at global scope, and the sharing of information between global and local environments. This paper presents a scalable model and evaluates by simulation a system where global market information circulates in aggregated and scalable form, the rate of demand by participants is globally regulated by a currency mechanism, preference is regulated by a reputation mechanism, and local regulation among competing participants is resolved by auction mechanisms. The paper shows how scalable systems benefit from distributed marketplaces supporting global information flow to regulate and optimize local and global behavior.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper introduces a new \"assist-as-needed\" (AAN) training paradigm for rehabilitation of spinal cord injuries via robotic training devices. In the pilot study reported in this paper, nine female adult Swiss-Webster mice were divided into three groups, each experiencing a different robotic training control strategy: a fixed training trajectory (fixed group, A), an AAN training method without interlimb coordination (Band Group, B), and an AAN training method with bilateral hind-limb coordination (Window Group, C). Fourteen days after complete transection at the mid-thoracic level, the mice were robotically trained to step in the presence of an acutely administered serotonin agonist, quipazine, for a period of six weeks. The mice that received AAN training (Groups B and C) show higher levels of recovery than Group A mice, as measured by the number, consistency, and periodicity of steps realized during testing sessions. Group C displays a higher incidence of alternating stepping than Group B. These results indicate that this training approach may be more effective than fixed trajectory paradigms in promoting robust post-injury stepping behavior. Furthermore, the constraint of interlimb coordination appears to be an important contribution to successful training\n",

            "Abstract: In countries like India, a great deal of diversity exists in language, culture and socio-economic conditions. In order to deliver computer aided education, efforts have to be put for proper management of concerned domain and learning materials keeping in mind this diversity. Participatory authoring of domain knowledge structure is of immense importance in this regard. In this paper, we describe a knowledge structure which is effective in capturing the structure of the learning materials of school level subjects. Ontologies have gained importance in representing the knowledge of the domain in a formal and machine understandable form in areas like intelligent information processing. Thus it can provide the platform for effective extraction of information and many other applications. We describe different aspects of manual ontology engineering in developing application specific domain ontology. The domain of our interest is the education domain where we are interested in retrieving relevant Web documents for the curriculum related requirements of school students. We identify an effective way of structuring the knowledge about these domains, which allows us to clearly demarcate the roles of topics, concepts, and actual words. We also describe applications in the area of information retrieval and in indexing document repositories in connection with e-learning where our ontology plays an important role. In this paper, we have provided a framework, Sahayika, for building knowledge structures in education domain.\n",

            "Abstract: A general framework for describing design rules is provided that encompasses space rules, size rules, extension rules, conditional rules, nonpositive rules, and minimum-type and maximum-type rules. Conditional rules considered include topological rules, width rules, and length rules. A fast compaction scheme was developed to handle this variety of rules in an efficient and uniform way. A compactor based on this approach was constructed that can handle several IBM technologies. In one CMOS technology, there are two width rules and two dozen topological rules, in addition to a hundred or so simple rules. The runtime performance data for several design examples, obtained on an IBM 3090 machine, are presented. It is noted that the use of conditional rules increases the computation cost only slightly, while it saves a significant amount of cell area compared with using all simple rules. >\n",

The approach uses a path planner that calculates optimal paths while considering uncertainty in position and that uses landmarks to localize the vehicle as part of the planning process. The landmarks are simple, possibly aliased, features that have been previously identified in a high-resolution map. These landmarks are combined with an estimate of the position of the vehicle to create unique and robust features. This approach reduces or eliminates the need for GPS and enables the use of prior maps with imperfect map registration.\n",

These polytopes are constructed by generating linear inequality constraints with coefficients drawn independently from a distribution such as the uniform or the normal. It is noted that this class of 'random' polytopes has a special property: the angles between the hyperplanes, though dependent on the specific distribution used, tend to be equal when the dimension of the space increases. Obviously this structure of 'random' polytopes may bias test results.\n",

            "Abstract: Most eigenstructure-based blind channel identification and equalization algorithms with second-order statistics need SVD or EVD of the correlation matrix of the received signal. In this paper, we address new algorithms based on QR factorization of the received signal directly without calculating the correlation matrix. This renders the QR factorization-based algorithms more robust against ill-conditioned channels, i.e., those channels with almost common zeros among the subchannels. First, we present a block algorithm that performs the QR factorization of the received data matrix as a whole. Then, a recursive algorithm is developed based on the QR factorization by updating a rank-revealing ULV decomposition. Compared with existing algorithms in the same category, our algorithms are computationally more efficient. The computation in each recursion of the recursive algorithm is on the order of O(m/sup 2/) if only equalization is required, where m is the dimension of the received signal vector. Our recursive algorithm preserves the fast convergence property of the subspace algorithms, thus converging faster than other adaptive algorithms such as the super-exponential algorithm with comparable computational complexities. Moreover, our proposed algorithms do not require noise variance estimation. Numerical simulations demonstrate the good performance of the proposed algorithms.\n",

            "Abstract: As the popularity of video streaming and sharing over the Internet grows, energy consumption in video server environments increases as well. This paper discusses how energy consumption is a critical concern for video servers and can limit their throughput. We investigate the energy consumption of storage components (disks) in video servers and propose two ways to reduce it for better throughput. First, we organize data on disks in a way that allows easier access by exploiting the inherent properties of video access patterns and giving priority to more important video data. Second, the prioritized ordering of video data allows the server to retrieve only the data required to meet quality of service agreements in an energy efficient way. Therefore, the video quality delivered to clients may be scaled in order to service more concurrent requests and/or reduce energy consumption. Results show that our strategies can increase the number of clients served by as much as 114% when compared to conventional approaches while also meeting constraints on video quality and energy consumption.\n",

The proof of a refinement law may be expressed in terms of the algebraic properties of programs required for the law to hold, rather than directly in terms of the semantics of a language. This has the advantage that the law is then valid for any programming language that satisfies the required algebraic properties. By characterised the important properties of programming languages algebraically we can devise simple proofs of common refinement laws. In this paper we consider standard refinement laws for sequential programs. We give simple characterisations of program invariants and well foundedness of statements.\n",

However, expressing oneýs preferences can require bidding on all bundles. We evaluate an approach known as incremental preference elicitation [3] and show that as the number of items increases, the amount of information required to clear the auction is a vanishing fraction of the information collected in direct revelation mechanisms. Most of the elicitors also maintain the benefit as the number of agents increases. We prove that randomization helps, in that no deterministic elicitor is a universal revelation reducer. Finally, we present a new query type that allows agents to use anytime algorithms to give approximate answers that are refined only as needed.\n",

            "Abstract: Schedule based MAC schemes do not perform well for dynamic network and traffic conditions. Their inflexibility makes them unsuitable for most real life applications. This inflexibility is due to the nature of schedule based approach. However, it depends mainly on the re-scheduling and slot allocation strategies employed. A flexible schedule based scheme should allow for the nodes to access the medium with different periodicity. The periodicity should be based on their traffic requirements which may result in improved channel utilization. However, traditionally used slot allocation protocols, e.g. RAND[1], do not consider the required medium access periodicity while allocating slot to the node. Thus, resulting schemes are not flexible to dynamic traffic conditions. This results in bandwidth wastage. In this paper, we propose a new flexible requirement aware RAND (RRAND) mechanism to allocate slots efficiently. Through simulations we show that our mechanism improves channel utilization on an average by about 60 %. The fairness characteristics are also improved significantly.\n",

In order to improve the faults of thrust allocation algorithms efficiently, the concept of group biasing is given and the adaptive strategy of group biasing method is designed. Consequently, the optimizing adaptive thrust allocation algorithm is proposed which bases on the group biasing and optimal methods, and the amplitude of bias can be adjusted adaptively according to thrust force. Applying the algorithm, the dynamic performances of dynamic positioned ships are improved availably, and the fuel consumption and maneuverability are both considered simultaneously.

            "Abstract: This paper presents an heuristic method to solve the combined resource selection and binding problems for the high-level synthesis of multiple-precision specifications. Traditionally, the number of functional (and storage) units in a datapath is determined by the maximum number of operations scheduled in the same cycle, with their respective widths depending on the number of bits of the wider operations. When these wider operations are not scheduled in such \"busy\" cycle, this way of acting could produce a considerable waste of area. To overcome this problem, we propose the selection of the set of resources taking into account the only truly relevant aspect: the maximum number of bits calculated and stored simultaneously in a cycle. The implementation obtained is a multiple-precision datapath, where the number and widths of the resources are independent of the specification operations and data objects.\n",

            "Abstract: Recent publications have proposed various information-theoretic learning (ITL) criteria based on Renyi's quadratic entropy with nonparametric kernel-based density estimation as alternative performance metrics for both supervised and unsupervised adaptive system training. These metrics, based on entropy and mutual information, take into account higher order statistics unlike the mean-square error (MSE) criterion. The drawback of these information-based metrics is the increased computational complexity, which underscores the importance of efficient training algorithms. In this paper, we examine familiar advanced-parameter search algorithms and propose modifications to allow training of systems with these ITL criteria. The well known algorithms tailored here for ITL include various improved gradient-descent methods, conjugate gradient approaches, and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. Sample problems and metrics are presented to illustrate the computational efficiency attained by employing the proposed algorithms.\n",

We propose a scheme that has essential characteristics for efficient, self-configuring and fault-tolerant resource discovery and is able to handle dynamic attributes, such as memory capacity. Our approach consists of an overlay network with a hypercube topology connecting the grid nodes and a scalable, fault-tolerant, self-configuring and adaptive search algorithm. Every grid node keeps a small routing table of only log 2 N entries. The search algorithm is executed in less than (log 2 N +1) time steps and each grid node is queried only once. By design, the algorithm improves the probability of reaching all working nodes in the system even in the presence of non-alive nodes (inaccessible, crashed or heavily loaded nodes). We analyze the static resilience of the approach presented, which is the measure of how well the algorithm can discover resources without having to update the routing tables. This is done before the routing recovery is processed in order to reconfigure the overlay to avoid non-alive nodes. The results show that our approach has a significantly high static resilience for a grid environment.\n",

Virtual colonoscopy (VC) provides fly-through navigation within the colon model, looking for polyps on the inner surface in a manner analogous to that of fiber optic colonoscopy. We have built an ECC pipeline for a commercial VC navigation system. In this paper, we present an improved ECC method. It is based on a partial-volume (PV) image-segmentation framework, which is derived using the well-established statistical expectation-maximization algorithm. The presented ECC method was evaluated by both visual inspection and computer-aided detection of polyps (CADpolyp) within the cleansed colon lumens obtained using 20 patient datasets. Compared to our previous ECC pipeline, which does not sufficiently consider the PV effect, the method presented in this paper demonstrates improved polyp detection by both visual judgment and CADpolyp measure\n",

            "Abstract: Little agreement exists as to acute dopamine DA manipulation effects on intertemporal choice in humans. We previously found that catechol-O-methyltransferase COMT Val158Met genotype predicts individual differences in immediate reward selection bias among adults. Moreover, we and others have shown that the relationship between COMT genotype and immediate reward bias is inverted in adolescents. No previous pharmacology studies testing DA manipulation effects on intertemporal choice have accounted for COMT genotype, and many have included participants in the adolescent age range 18-21 years as adults. Moreover, many studies have included female participants without strict cycle phase control, although recent evidence demonstrates that cyclic estradiol elevations interact with COMT genotype to affect DA-dependent cognition. These factors may have interacted with DA manipulations in past studies, potentially occluding detection of effects. Therefore, we predicted that, among healthy male adults ages 22-40 years, frontal DA tone, as indexed by COMT genotype, would interact with acute changes in DA signaling to affect intertemporal choice. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, we decreased central DA via administration of an amino acid beverage deficient in the DA precursors, phenylalanine and tyrosine, and tested effects on immediate reward bias in a delay-discounting DD task and working memory WM in an n-back task. We found no main effect of beverage on DD or WM performance but did find significant beverage*genotype effects. These results suggest that the effect of DA manipulations on DD depends on individual differences in frontal DA tone, which may have impeded some past efforts to characterize DA's role in immediate reward bias in humans.\n",

However, other problems have come to the drivers: When should they (the drivers or the new automated systems) be able to take control of the vehicle? This question has not a simple answer; it de-pends on different conditions, such as: the environment, driver condition, vehicle capabilities, fault tolerance, among others. For this reason, in this work we will analyze the acceptability to the ADAS functions available in the market, and its relation with the different control actions. In this paper a survey on arbitration and control solutions in ADAS is presented. It will allow to create the basis for future development of a generic ADAS control (the lateral and longitudinal behavior), based on the integration of the application request, the driver behavior and driving conditions in the framework of the DESERVE project (DEvelopment platform for Safe and Efficient dRiVE 1 , a ARTEMIS project 2012-2105). The main aim of this work is to allow the development of a new generation of ADAS solutions where the control could be effectively shared between the vehicle and the driver. Different solutions of shared control have been analyzed. A first approach is proposed, based on the presented solutions.\n",

This study investigates whether the effectiveness of the computer assistant with an iCat robot embodiment, can be improved when it expresses emotions (tested for each of the three roles). It shows that emotion expressions can improve the effectiveness of the robot to achieve its role objectives. The improvements that we found are small, however, probably due to a ceiling effect: All subjective measures are rated very positively in the neutral condition, thus leaving little room for improvement. It also showed that the emotional speech was less intelligible, which may limit the robots' effectiveness.\n",

Bisimilarity simplifies equivalence proofs in the calculus and opens a way for more convenient correctness proofs for program transformations. Although this property may be a natural one to expect, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one providing a proof. The proof technique is to transfer the contextual approximation into Abramsky's lazy lambda calculus by a fully abstract and surjective translation. This also shows that the natural embedding of Abramsky's lazy lambda calculus into the call-by-need lambda calculus with letrec is an isomorphism between the respective term-models. We show that the equivalence property proven in this paper transfers to a call-by-need letrec calculus developed by Ariola and Felleisen.\n",

Measurements of a commercially available UWB antenna performance in an anechoic chamber and in various indoor multipath environments were conducted. Comparisons of these measurement results indicate that while the human body creates a deep null (23.6 dB) in a light multipath environment, this null is drastically reduced (6.8 dB) in a dense multipath environment.\n",

            "Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been of high interest during the past couple of years. One of the most important aspects of WSN research is location estimation. As a good solution of fine grained localization Reichenbach et al. introduced the Distributed Least Squares (DLS) algorithm, which splits the costly localization process in a complex precalculation and a simple postcalculation which is performed on constrained sensor nodes to finalize the localization by adding locale knowledge. This approach lacks for large WSNs, because cost of communication and Computation theoretically increases with the network size. In practice the approach is even unusable for large WSNs. An important assumption of DLS is that each blind node is able to communicate with each beacon node to receive the precalculation and to determine distances to beacon nodes. This restriction have been overcome by scalable DLS (sDLS), which enabled to use the idea of DLS in large WSNs for the first time.

            "Abstract: In this paper, a new simple and complete technique of modeling and analysis of a matrix converter is presented based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of modulation matrix. The proposed modeling method yields a new limitation between the matrix converter gain and its input power factor, which is more relaxed as compared to the limits reported so far in the literature. The SVD of the modulation matrix leads to a unified modulation technique which achieves the full capability of a matrix converter. It is shown that this approach is general and all other modulation methods established for a matrix converter are specific cases of this technique. The proposed modulation method can be used to obtain the maximum reactive power in the input of a matrix converter in applications such as wind turbine and microturbine generators, where the input reactive power control is necessary.\n",

            "Abstract: A linear (circular) consecutive k-out-of-n:F system is a system of n linearly (circularly) ordered components which fails if and only if at least k consecutive components fail. We use recursive relationships on the reliability of such systems with independent identically distributed components to show that for any fixed k, the lifetime of a (linear or circular) consecutive k-out-of-n:F system is stochastically decreasing in n. This result also holds for linear systems when the components are independent and not necessarily identically distributed, but not in general for circular systems.\n",

            "Abstract: The need for copyright protection has become a detachable requirement for online media e-business as online multimedia businesses and enabling technologies become viable in recent years. Watermarking enables copyright protection in e-business but it also slows down the packaging process for delivery. The requirement of instant delivery is a prime requirement for online business. In the literature, extensive research on watermarking performance has been emphasized on imperceptibility and robustness but not the efficiency factor for online e-business, for example processing time and storage requirement that are crucial to the success of online e-business. We investigate four watermarking schemes derived from one-bit watermarking, multiple-bit watermarking and their combinations in order to identify a viable watermarking scheme that can meet the requirements of online e-business. The performance of these schemes in terms of preparation time, delivery time and storage requirement are measured and reported. Our analysis proves that the watermarking schemes with multiple-bit watermarking can ensure instant delivery with a penalty of some extra storage requirements.\n",

            "Abstract: Memories are significant proportions of most digital systems and memory-intensive chips continue to lead the migration to new nano-fabrication processes. As these processes have increasingly higher defect rates, especially when they are first adopted, such early migration necessitates the use of increasing levels of redundancy to obtain high yield (per area). We show that as we move into nanometer processes with high defect rates, the level of redundancy needed to optimize yield-per-area is sufficiently high so as to significantly influence design tradeoffs. We then report a first step towards considering the overheads of redundancy during design optimization by characterizing the tradeoffs between the granularity of a design and the level of redundancy that optimizes the yield-per-area of static RAMs (SRAMs). Starting with physical layouts of cells and the desired memory size, we derive probabilities of failure at a range of abstractions - transistor level, cell level, and system level. We then estimate optimal memory granularity, i.e., the size of memory blocks, as well as the optimal number of spare rows and columns that maximize yield-per-area. In particular, we demonstrate the non-monotonic nature of these tradeoffs and present efficient designs for large SRAMs. Our ongoing research is characterizing several other specific tradeoffs, for SRAMs as well as logic blocks.\n",

            "Abstract: A single-server queueing model is considered with customers that have deadlines. If a customer’s deadline elapses before service is offered, the customer abandons the system (customers do not abandon while being served). When the server becomes available, it offers service to the customer having the earliest deadline among those that are in the queue. We obtain a fluid limit of the queue length and abandonment processes and for the occupation measure of deadlines, in the form of measure-valued processes. We characterize the limit by means of a Skorohod problem in a time-varying domain that has an explicit solution. The fluid limits also describe a certain process called the frontier that is well known to play a key role in systems operating under this scheduling policy.\n",

However, this adaptation process misses the time elapsed since the user has bought an item, which is an essential parameter that affects differently to each purchased product. This results in some useless recommendations, including regularly items that the users are only willing to buy sporadically. In this paper, we explore a new recommendation strategy that offers time-aware suggestions to e-commerce users, by enhancing reasoning techniques from the Semantic Web with item-dependent time functions. This combination leads to suggestions adapted to the particular needs of each user at any given moment.\n",

However, as the VMs from different customers are running on the same host, an attack to the management virtual machine will easily lead to the compromise of the guest VMs. Therefore, it is critical for a cloud computing system to ensure the trustworthiness of management VMs. To this end, we propose VMGuard, an integrity monitoring and detecting system for management virtual machines in a distributed environment. VMGuard utilizes a special VM, Guard Domain, which runs on each physical node to monitor the co-resident management VMs. The integrity measurements collected by the Guard Domains are sent to the VMGuard server for safe store and independent analysis. The experimental evaluation of a Xen-based prototype shows that VMGuard can quickly detect the root kit attacks while the performance overhead is low.\n",

Depletion in small semiconductor crystals is characterized by the occurrence of new type depletion (volume depletion) after conventional one (regional depletion), and inclusion of both types makes it possible to formulate the receptor function and response to oxygen (air base), oxidizing gas (nitrogen dioxide), and reducing gas (hydrogen). The equations derived theoretically using physical parameters of the semiconductor side and chemical parameters of the gases side appear to reproduce satisfactorily the sensing behavior to the aforementioned gases as well as the influence of changes in physical parameters such as grain size and donor density. Extension to the semiconductor crystals dispersed with surface electron-traps shows that the traps act as a sensitizer to promote sensor response.\n",

            "Abstract: IP-lookup is a challenging problem because of the increasing routing table sizes, increased traffic and higher speed links. These characteristics lead to the prevalence of hardware solutions such as TCAMs (ternary content addressable memories), despite their high power consumption, low update rate and increased board area requirements. We propose a memory architecture called IPStash to act as a TCAM replacement, offering at the same time, high update rate, higher performance and significant power savings. The premise of our work is that full associativity is not necessary for IP-lookup. Rather, we show that the required associativity is simply a function of the routing table size, Thus, we propose a memory architecture similar to set-associative caches but enhanced with mechanisms to facilitate IP-lookup and in particular longest prefix match (LPM). To reach a minimum level of required associativity we introduce an iterative method to perform LPM in a small number of iterations. This allows us to insert route prefixes of different lengths in IPStash very efficiently, selecting the most appropriate index in each case. Orthogonal to this, we use skewed associativity to increase the effective capacity of our devices. We thoroughly examine different choices in partitioning routing tables for the iterative LPM and the design space for the IPStash devices. The proposed architecture is also easily expandable. Using the Cacti 3.2 access time and power consumption simulation tool we explore the design space for IPStash devices and we compare them with the best blocked commercial TCAMs.\n",

In the most conventional position control system of a WMR, internal error is mainly considered, while external error has, as yet, hardly been treated, although it plays an important role in accurate position control. This external error is caused by unexpected environmental situations. The proposed control algorithm is designed to compensate for both internal error and external error. This algorithm makes it possible to accurately follow the designed trajectory.\n",

Furthermore, within the networks satisfying these graphical properties, this article identifies further sets of conditions so that the associated computational complexity becomes linear in the number of sensor nodes. We show how, by forming a spanning tree used once for distances and a second time for bearings where the underlying graph is connected, the localization problem can be made solvable in linear time with significantly less number of sensing links and smaller sensing radii of nodes compared with the cooperative networks with distance-only or bearing-only measurements. These easily localizable networks can be localized in polynomial time when measurements are noisy.\n",

The systems were developed for participation in the Rich Transcription evaluations conducted by the National Institute for Standards and Technology in the years 2007 and 2009 and can process close talking and far field microphone recordings. The paper first discusses fundamental properties of meeting data with special focus on the AMI/AMIDA corpora. This is followed by a description and analysis of improved processing and modeling, with focus on techniques specifically addressing meeting transcription issues such as multi-room recordings or domain variability. In 2007 and 2009, two different strategies of systems building were followed. While in 2007 we used our traditional style system design based on cross adaptation, the 2009 systems were constructed semi-automatically, supported by improved decoders and a new method for system representation. Overall these changes gave a 6%-13% relative reduction in word error rate compared to our 2007 results while at the same time requiring less training material and reducing the real-time factor by five times.

Let N = (V,E) be an undirected connected simple network, where V is the vertex set, |V| = n and E is the edge set. There is a nonnegative demand wj associated with every vertex uj. It is assumed that every edge (ui,uj) has a probability of failure pij and that failures can never occur on two edges simultaneously. The problem consists of locating p facilities on the network so that the total expected demand disconnected from the facilities is minimized. This problem occurs naturally in the fields of computer and telecommunications networks. A number of important results are proved. First, there always exists a solution in which all facilities are located at vertices. Second, the problem can always be solved optimally on the so-called leaf-tree associated with the network. Third, when p = 1, the problem is a 1-median problem. When p > 1, there always exists an optimal solution for which all facilities are located at pendent vertices of the tree. Finally, when p > 2, the problem with p + 1 facilities can be solved in a greedy fashion, starting from a solution to the problem with p facilities. An exact algorithm for this problem is described. It can be executed in either O(np + |E|) time or in O(n log n + |E|) time. A numerical example is provided.\n",

The Region Connection Calculus (RCC) and egg-yolk methods have proven useful for the representation of vague regions in spatial data.

In this study we use a rough set foundation for expressing topological relationships previously defined for the RCC and egg-yolk methods and show that rough sets can improve on the representation of topological relationships and concepts defined with the other models, which leads to improved mining of spatial data. Finally, we provide an extension of spatial association rule generation that will be able to use rough set–modeled spatial data. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

            "Abstract: As the recognition of emotion from speech has matured to a degree where it becomes applicable in real-life settings, it is time for a realistic view on obtainable performances. Most studies tend to overestimation in this respect: Acted data is often used rather than spontaneous data, results are reported on preselected prototypical data, and true speaker disjunctive partitioning is still less common than simple cross-validation. Even speaker disjunctive evaluation can give only a little insight into the generalization ability of today's emotion recognition engines since training and test data used for system development usually tend to be similar as far as recording conditions, noise overlay, language, and types of emotions are concerned. A considerably more realistic impression can be gathered by interset evaluation: We therefore show results employing six standard databases in a cross-corpora evaluation experiment which could also be helpful for learning about chances to add resources for training and overcoming the typical sparseness in the field. To better cope with the observed high variances, different types of normalization are investigated. 1.8 k individual evaluations in total indicate the crucial performance inferiority of inter to intracorpus testing.\n",

Given the pervasiveness of embedded systems, especially in the area of highly dependable and safety-critical systems, it is imperative to directly consider dependability in the system level design process. This naturally leads to a multi-objective optimization problem, as cost and time have to be considered too. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm to solve this multi-objective optimization problem and to determine a set of Pareto optimal design alternatives in a single optimization run. Based on these alternatives, the designer can choose his best solution, finding the desired tradeoff between cost, schedulability, and dependability.\n",

Physically based models are required, however, to relate the geophysical quantities being measured by the radar sensor to useful geologic information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data over the Cima volcanic field in the Mojave Desert of California are quantitatively connected with microtopography through inversion of a radar backscatter model. Changes in surface roughness inferred from the derived microtopography are modeled and found to be consistent with aeolian mantling as surfaces age. Estimated rates of aeolian deposition for the Cima area are compared to the Lunar Crater volcanic field in Nevada. Rates of deposition appear to be higher at Cima volcanic field, most likely because of its proximity to Soda Lake, the main source of the aeolian material. >\n",

The changing environment is modeled as an accumulation function which grows in areas that are not within range of the robot, and decreases in areas that are within range of the robot. The robot must continually move through the environment to prevent the accumulation of any area from growing unbounded. We consider the case in which a predefined path is given for the robot, and we focus on controlling the robot's speed along the path. We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions on the speed controller of the robot for keeping the accumulation function bounded. We then search among the space of speed controllers that are parametrized by a finite set of basis functions. We develop a linear program to compute the optimal speed controller; that which minimizes the accumulation over the environment. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the controllers.\n",

            "Abstract: Bounded model checking---as well as symbolic equivalence checking---are highly successful techniques in the hardware domain. Recently, bit-vector bounded model checkers like CBMC have been developed that are able to check properties of (mostly low-level) software written in C. However, using these tools to check equivalence of software implementations has rarely been pursued. In this case study we tackle the problem of proving the functional equivalence of two implementations ofthe AES crypto-algorithm using automatic bounded model checking techniques. Cryptographic algorithms heavily rely on bit-level operations, which makes them particularly suitable for bit-precise tools like CBMC. Other software verification tools based on abstraction refinement or static analysis seem to be less appropriate for such software. We could semi-automatically prove equivalence of the first three rounds of the AES encryption routines. Moreover, by conducting a manually assisted inductive proof, we could show equivalence of the full AES encryption process.\n",

            "Abstract: Preemptive schedulers have been widely adopted in single processor real-time systems to avoid the blocking associated with the non-preemptive execution of lower priority tasks and achieve a high processor utilization. However, under fixed priority assignments, there are cases in which limiting preemptions can improve schedulability with respect to a fully preemptive solution. This is true even neglecting preemption overhead, as it will be shown in the paper. In previous works, limited-preemption schedulers have been mainly considered to reduce the preemption overhead, and make the estimation of worst-case execution times more predictable. In this work, we instead show how to improve the feasibility of fixed-priority task systems by executing the last portion of each task in a non-preemptive fashion. A proper dimensioning of such a region of code allows increasing the number of task sets that are schedulable with a fixed priority algorithm. Simulation experiments are also presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n",

The approach is based on the observation that very different examples generalize to an expression that is very far from each of them, while identical examples generalize to themselves. Following this idea the authors propose some domain-independent and intuitively justified estimates for the conceptual distance. A hierarchical conceptual clustering algorithm that groups objects so as to maximize the cohesiveness (a reciprocal of the conceptual distance) of the clusters is presented. It is shown that conceptual clustering can improve learning from complex examples describing objects and the relation between them. >\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, a high-speed residue-to-binary converter for the recently introduced moduli set (2/sup k/, 2/sup k/-1, 2/sup k-1/-1) is proposed. Compared to the previous converter based on this moduli set, the proposed one is 40% faster; also, the time-complexity product is improved by 20%. Following the VLSI design flow established by the Canadian Microelectronics Corporation, the proposed converter is implemented in 0.5-micron CMOS technology. Based on this moduli set, layouts of the 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit residue-to-binary converters which can be used in further RNS system designs, are generated and simulation results obtained.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper is dedicated to our friend and mentor, Cyrus Derman, on the occasion of his 60th birthday.#R##N##R##N#The multi-armed bandit problem arises in sequentially allocating effort to one of N projects and sequentially assigning patients to one of N treatments in clinical trials. Gittins and Jones Gittins, J. C., Jones, D. M. 1974. A dynamic allocation index for the sequential design of experiments. J. Gani, K. Sarkadi, L. Vince, eds. Progress in Statistics. European Meeting of Statisticians, 1972, 1, North Holland, Amsterdam, 241--266. have shown that one optimal policy for the N-project problem, an N-dimensional discounted Markov decision chain, is determined by the following largest-index rule. There is an index for each state of each given project that depends only on the data of that project. In each period one allocates effort to a project with largest current index. The purpose of this paper is to give a short proof of this result and a new characterization of the index of a project in state i, viz., as the maximum expected present value in state i for the restart-in-i problem in which, in each state and period, one either continues allocating effort to the project or immediately restarts the project in state i. Moreover, it is shown that an approximate largest-index rule yields an approximately optimal policy. These results lead to more efficient methods of computing the indices on-line and/or for sparse transition matrices in large state spaces than have been suggested heretofore. By using a suitable implementation of successive approximations, a policy whose expected present value is within 100e% of the maximum possible range of values of the indices can be found on-line with at most N + T-1TM operations where M is the number of operations required to calculate one approximation, T is the least integer majorizing the ratio ln e/ln a and 0 <a < 1 is the discount factor.\n",

            "Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate that how closing the loop between operational dynamics and investment decisions for microgrids allows us to explicitly incorporate short-term operational volatility and long-term financing and market variations into investment decisions. Here, microgrid cost savings function describing the short-term benefit growth of the micro-grid under short-term (operational) uncertainties is fed into a stochastic long-term investment model. It turns out that cost saving function can be expressed as a regression function on a number of indices defined by design and operational characteristics of microgrids. Two regression models are constructed. Model (I) is a pure linear model and model II includes linear terms and an interaction term. Two sets of experiments (I and II) and results are demonstrated. Experiment (I) focuses on how volatility measures impact investment decisions. In experiment (II) the impact of operational interactions of generation assets in investment decisions is demonstrated.\n",

One approach to localization which is based on vision is to compute camera egomotion with respect to base images. What characterizes this method of localization is that its performance varies greatly in different positions. Active navigation is an approach to path and sensing planning which is designed to address varying performance of a sensor across the configuration space. We describe how to integrate a vision-based localization sensor with active navigation. We explain the localization process, how its performance varies across the configuration space, and the use of this variation by active navigation.\n",

            "Abstract: A new form of bandpass convolutional decoder termed the TAR decoder is presented. The decoder has as its basis the classic Viterbi algorithm, but uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT) in order to cope with a frequency offset, phase rotating, received signal. The TAR decoder also uses a two-dimensional (2-D) despread signal history array in addition to the usual path history registers. The advantage of the TAR decoder is that the decoder does not need to be preceded by a modem and is not subject to the problems of cycle slips. It can operate at negative input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values and is well suited to the decoding of low rate convolutional codes as may be used in code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. Symbol timing recovery is still required but this is straightforward in practical cases down to /spl sime/-15 dB SNR.\n",

            "Abstract: Topic spotting is often performed on the output of a large vocabulary recognizer or a keyword spotter. However, this requires detailed knowledge about the vocabulary, and transcribed training data. If portability to new topics and languages is important, then a topic spotter based on phoneme recognition is preferable. A phoneme recognizer is run on training data consisting of audio files labeled by topic alone-no word transcripts are required. Phoneme sub-sequences which help to predict the topic are then extracted automatically. The work described was carried out by two teams exploring three very different approaches to phoneme-based topic spotting: the \"DP-ngram\", the \"decision tree\", and the \"Euclidean\" approach. Results obtained by each team on the ARM (Airborne Reconnaissance Mission) and Switchboard data sets were compared by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The best performance for each team was obtained via a similar type of discriminative training.\n",

            "Abstract: Community noise regulations put stringent requirements on the exterior noise emission of vehicles. Noise from engines and tyres is the main contribution to noise pollution caused by traffic. It is imperative that automotive manufactures invest a lot of effort and money to improve the vibro-acoustics performance of their products. The enhancement effort may be very difficult and time-consuming if one relies only on trial and error' method without prior knowledge about the sources itself. The implementation of sound source models is much faster than the trial and error' methods. The purpose of this paper is to develop simple source models for engine noise using a mock-up panel of loudspeakers set up following the substituted monopole technique. The number and quantification of the sub-source factors is established here by the different cases under study. The real-life experience of listening to this sound is assessed by the implementation of DIN 45631/ISO 532B Loudness representation and the evaluation of the related sound quality, together with the annoyance level, are determined in a quick and economical manner.\n",

            "Abstract: Today, one of the major challenges in full-vehicle model creation is to get domain models from different experts while detecting any potential inconsistency problem before the Integration, Verification, Validation, and Qualification phase. To overcome such challenges, the conceptual design phase has been adapted to the current model development process. For that, the system engineers start to define the most relevant system architecture by respecting quality and time constraints. Next, the simulation model architects design the delivered system architecture in a more formal way with a modeling and simulation point of view to support the integration of domain-level simulation models in a consistent fashion. Finally, the model architects negotiate with different simulation model providers with the aim of specifying vehicle- and domain-level simulation models and their interface connections. To improve knowledge sharing between the mentioned actors, we propose a model identity card (MIC) for classifying simulation model knowledge, including input/output parameters, method, and usage specifications. The fundamental concepts that form the basis of all simulation models are identified and typed for implementation into a computational environment. An industrial case study of the engine–after-treatment model is used to show how MICs and the integrated model design phase might be used in a given scenario. A validation protocol is conducted through a heuristic observation to estimate the rate of model rework and ambiguity reduction.\n",

            "Abstract: When the user interface should be specified, a picture is worth a thou- sand words, and the worst thing to do is write a natural language specification for it. Although this practice is still common, it is a challenging task to move from text-based requirements and problem-space concepts to a final UI design, and then back. Especially for user interface specification, actors must frequently switch be- tween high-level descriptions and low-level detailed screens. In our research we found out that advanced specifications should to be made up of interconnected ar- tefacts that have distinct levels of abstraction. With regards to the transparency and traceability of the rationale of the specification process, transitions and de- pendencies must be visual and traversable. For this purpose, a user interface speci- fication method is introduced that interactively integrates interdisciplinary and in- formal modelling languages with different levels of fidelity of user interface prototyping. With an innovative experimental tool, we finally assemble models and design to an interactive user interface specifications.\n",

This makes research in this subject very hard, mainly for a beginner or someone who does not wish to become a specialist but just to find the most suitable ideas for his own research activity. The goal of this paper is to introduce a certain number of papers related with grammatical inference. Some of these papers are essential and should constitute a common background to research in the area, whereas others are specialized on particular problems or techniques, but can be of great help on specific tasks.\n",

            "Abstract: The Frechet distance is a well-studied and very popular measure of similarity of two curves. Many variants and extensions have been studied since Alt and Godau introduced this measure to computational geometry in 1991. Their original algorithm to compute the Frechet distance of two polygonal curves with n vertices has a runtime of O(n^2 log n). More than 20 years later, the state of the art algorithms for most variants still take time more than O(n2 / log n), but no matching lower bounds are known, not even under reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions. To obtain a conditional lower bound, in this paper we assume the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis or, more precisely, that there is no O*((2-adelta;)N) algorithm for CNF-SAT for any delta > 0. Under this assumption we show that the Frechet distance cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic time, i.e., in time O(n2-adelta;) for any delta > 0. This means that finding faster algorithms for the Frechet distance is as hard as finding faster CNF-SAT algorithms, and the existence of a strongly subquadratic algorithm can be considered unlikely. Our result holds for both the continuous and the discrete Frechet distance. We extend the main result in various directions. Based on the same assumption we (1) show non-existence of a strongly subquadratic 1.001-approximation, (2) present tight lower bounds in case the numbers of vertices of the two curves are imbalanced, and (3) examine realistic input assumptions (c-packed curves).\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of finding an efficient schedule for broadcasting a given set of data items over multiple physical broadcast channels. The goal of our work is twofold: (a) to minimize the average access latency to fulfill data requests of mobile clients and (b) to provide the ability to tune the period length of the broadcast schedule so as to ease the air-indexing process and to enable clients to determine when the desired data item is broadcast next. To achieve these goals, we propose a parameterized scheduler, called FlexSched, which is a polynomial time algorithm and uses a divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently obtain a solution to the problem. To evaluate the robustness and solution quality of FlexSched, we conducted an extensive performance study by using several synthetic data sets. The results show that FlexSched may significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art data scheduling algorithms with relatively low computational costs.\n",

            "Abstract: The ideal class groups of hyperelliptic curves (HECs) can be used in cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm problem. Recent developments of computational technologies for scalar multiplications of divisor classes have shown that the performance of hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems (HECC) is compatible to that of elliptic curve cryptosystems. Especially, due to short operand sizes, genus 3 HECC are well suited for all kinds of embedded processor architectures, where resources such as storage, time or power are constrained. In the paper, the acceleration of the divisor class doubling for genus 3 HECs over binary fields is investigated and the number of field operations needed is analysed. By constructing birational transformations of variables, four types of curves which can lead to much faster divisor class doubling are found and the corresponding explicit formulae are given. In particular, for special genus 3 HECs over binary fields with h(X)=1, the fastest explicit doubling formula published so far which only requires one field inversion, ten field multiplications and eleven field squarings, is obtained. Furthermore, comparisons with the known results in terms of field operations and implementations of genus 3 HECC over three different binary fields on a Pentium-4 processor are provided.\n",

The complexity of the spatio-temporal information manipulated by a Geographic Information System (GIS) has demanded special efforts for the creation of a conceptual data model able to represent reality phenomena naturally. This paper presents some requirements of a temporal conceptual model for GIS applications. Then, the conceptual framework GeoFrame-T is presented as a temporal extension of the conceptual framework GeoFrame, which was proposed by Lisboa [1]. GeoFrame is based on the OO formalism and uses the Unified Modeling Language - UML as modeling language. The temporal extension proposed for GeoFrame expands some concepts of Temporal Unified Modeling Language - TUML [3], adapting it to the spatio-temporal view, making it possible to model geographic phenomena in a more realistic way.\n",

            "Abstract: In design, the form creation process involves imagining, seeing and drawing. Translating the vague and imprecise initial ideas into sketches requires significant ability, and in this process, images of existing products (precedents) are a welcomed aid. Searching for them, however, is difficult, because it requires either exhaustive browsing or verbalization of the ideas to be able to use search engines.This paper presents an approach that uses images as query seeds instead of keywords called Query by Example (QBE). This approach is tested through an empirical study. It shows that the approach is a significant step into helping designers satisfy their visual information needs. It also shows that, as designers change their focus from function to context to form, their way of expressing their information needs changes. It concludes suggesting ways of improving both current systems and the QBE software tested.\n",

For the applications of parallel mechanisms in the field of sensor, previous work was focused on investigating the 6 degree-of-freedom force/torque sensors based on common Gough-Stewart platform. In this paper, a novel design of a multidimensional acceleration sensor is proposed based on 3RRPRR fully decoupling parallel elastic mechanism for kinetic information acquisition, specifically for measuring human motions. The translational elements of three perpendicular legs are served as elastic body which is manufactured by aluminum alloy. The detailed design of the structure is first introduced, followed by the mathematics modeling and performance evaluation.

The JISC Information Governance Gateway (JIGG) project aims to provide a single online gateway into information and resources related to HEIs' compliance with information governance legislation, including FOI. One of the project's objectives is to provide dissemination of the FOI disclosure logs by a web search within the gateway and also using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).

Carrier frequency offset (CFO) must be compensated before channel estimation and coherent detection. Normally, training sequences are sent for CFO estimation and channel estimation before the data transmission. However, an improper selection of training sequences may cause failure in CFO estimation, resulting in the identifiability problem. In this paper, we present a detailed study on identifiability issue relate with data-aided CFO estimation. We firstly propose a theorem that is applicable for all training sequences. Then, the theorem is modified to deal with a popular set of training sequences that is deemed as optimal for channel estimation. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed study.\n",

To show the feasibility of our approach, we have applied it in a case study. We have taken a large and realistic vegetation-classification system, and have analysed its behaviour under various varieties of incomplete and incorrect input. This case study shows that degradation studies can reveal interesting and surprising properties of the system under study.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we exploit the heterogeneity of wireless channels and propose an efficient opportunistic cognitive routing (OCR) scheme for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks. We first introduce a novel routing metric by jointly considering physical characteristics of spectrum bands and diverse activities of primary users (PU) in each band. To effectively explore the spectrum opportunities, a proper channel sensing sequence for fast and reliable message delivery is determined by secondary users (SU) in a distributed way. We then develop a greedy forwarding scheme that SUs can select the next hop relay based on the geometry information and channel access opportunity of their one hop neighbors. For the proposed OCR, as routing control messages are locally exchanged, SUs can efficiently make the routing decision and opportunistically access the available channels. We further evaluate the performance of OCR via extensive simulations. It is shown that our proposed scheme outperforms existing opportunistic routing schemes in DSA networks by exploiting the heterogeneity of spectrum bands for opportunistic channel access.\n",

A Web caching framework is characterized by its cache replacement policy, which identifies the objects (i.e. the elements on a Web page, which include text, graphics, and scripts) to be replaced in a cache upon a request arrival. In this paper, we present a cache replacement algorithm (so-called FRES-CAR), which identifies the objects that should be evicted by considering together three important criteria: object's frequency, recency and size. Experimentation under synthetic workloads has shown that FRES-CAR achieves higher hit rates when compared with the most popular and existing algorithms\n",

            "Abstract: New portable consumer embedded devices must execute multimedia and wireless network applications that demand extensive memory footprint. Moreover, they must heavily rely on dynamic memory (DM) due to the unpredictability of the input data (e.g. 3D streams features) and system behaviour (e.g. number of applications running concurrently defined by the user). Within this context, consistent design methodologies that can tackle efficiently the complex DM behaviour of these multimedia and network applications are in great need. In this paper, we present a new methodology that allows to design custom DM management mechanisms with a reduced memory footprint for such kind of dynamic applications. The experimental results in real case studies show that our methodology improves memory footprint 60% on average over current state-of-the-art DM managers.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, the authors analyze the effects of system bandwidth, transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) separation distance and line-of-sight (LOS) blockage on the ranging error in realistic ultra-wideband (UWB) channels. Data collected from extensive UWB indoor propagation channel measurements conducted in various types of apartments with bandwidth of 7 GHz are used to study the above effects. Here, a threshold-based time-of-arrival (ToA) estimator is employed to estimate the ToA of the first arriving path. An optimum threshold value is set for each measurement data set according to the channel operating conditions by adapting the thresholding technique proposed in Dardari and Win, 2006, Analysis of the measurement results show that the ranging error is independent of the TX-RX separation distance. However, the presence of LOS blockage increases the ranging error due to the positive bias introduce by different materials that block the LOS path. We then develop a model to quantify the effect of bandwidth on the ranging error due to multipath dispersion, which is found to be well-modeled by an exponential function.\n",

            "Abstract: Object-oriented frameworks can make parallel programming easier by providing generic parallel algorithms such as map, reduce, or pipeline and letting the user fill in the details with sequential code. However, such frameworks can produce incorrect behavior if they are not carefully used, e.g., if a user-supplied function performs an unsynchronized access to a global variable. We develop novel techniques that can prevent such errors. Building on a language (Deterministic Parallel Java, or DPJ) with an expressive region-based type and effect system, we show how to write a framework API that enables sound reasoning about the effects of unknown user-supplied methods. We also describe novel extensions to DPJ that enable generic types and effects while retaining soundness. We present a formal semantics and soundness properties for the language. Finally, we describe an evaluation showing that our technique can express three parallel frameworks and three realistic parallel algorithms using those frameworks.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper proposes a method to autonomously extract stable visual landmarks from sensory data. Given a 2D occupancy map, a mobile robot first extracts vertical line features which are distinct and on vertical planar surfaces, because they are expected to be observed reliably from various viewpoints. Since the feature information such as the position and the length includes uncertainties due to errors of vision and motion of the robot, the robot then reduces the uncertainty by matching the planar surface containing the features to the map. As a result, the robot obtains modeled stable visual landmarks from the extracted features. These processes are performed online in order to adapt to actual changes of lighting and scene depending on the robot's view. Experimental results in various scenes show the validity of the proposed method.\n",

            "Abstract: Fast response of hydraulic turbines is a key condition for the integration of renewable sources of energy. In this paper, a new start-up strategy is proposed for hydraulic turbines prone to “S” instability. This method is based on a complete nonlinear model of the turbine together with the upstream water pipe. More precisely, the control strategy is based on a gain scheduling approach that is computed using finite horizon predictive control. This yields a state feedback control law that tracks a time-optimal trajectory that is computed based on the nonlinear model of the system. Simulations are shown to assess the efficiency of the proposed law and its robustness to model discrepancies.\n",

            "Abstract: We use a simple genetic algorithm with distributed fitness evaluation to optimize the simulated aerodynamic performance of idealized three-dimensional models of vehicles (car, truck) in a virtual wind-tunnel. The genetic algorithm manipulates part of the collection of numerical constants (genotype of candidate solutions) which describe the shape of said vehicle-models. For evaluation of fitness, the genotypes in a small population of 1630 candidate solutions are translated into virtual vehicle-models (phenotypes) inside a mesh of specified density. The vehicle-models' wind-resistance which defines the inverse-proportional fitness of the associated genotypes is computed via the software package in parallel. After an optimization procedure over 100 generations when saturation of fitness improvement is seemingly achieved, we obtain (1) an optimized simple car-model which (up to practically necessary modifications) can be seen, in principle, on today's roads and (2), surprisingly, an optimized design for the driver's cabin of a truck and an air-shield on top of the latter which appears to be a new design. Both shapes found by the genetic algorithm described in this work significantly outperform elementary geometric shapes such as triangular or parabolic shapes in a simulation of aerodynamic resistance. The application of the findings in this work could yield to significant energy savings in the transport sector in the future.\n",

            "Abstract: Header compression saves bandwidth, but it also introduces error propagation whenever packets are lost. We propose to use error correcting codes on the compressed packet headers. The result is an overall system that maintains most of the bandwidth savings of header compression and yet is robust with respect to errors. The key to achieving this tradeoff is appropriate distribution of parity symbols across the packets. The proposed system performs better than ordinary header compression and as well as the TWICE algorithm. In most cases, the effects of the error propagation can be almost removed, such that the end-to-end packet loss rate is similar to a system with no header compression, while the bitrate savings are largely maintained.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper presents a new frame-skipping transcoding approach for video combiners in multipoint video conferencing. Transcoding is regarded as a process of converting a previously compressed video bitstream into a lower bitrate bitstream. A high transcoding ratio may result in an unacceptable picture quality when the incoming video bitstream is transcoded with the full frame rate. Frame skipping is often used as an efficient scheme to allocate more bits to representative frames, so that an acceptable quality for each frame can be maintained. However, the skipped frame must be decompressed completely, and should act as the reference frame to the nonskipped frame for reconstruction. The newly quantized DCT coefficients of prediction error need to be recomputed for the nonskipped frame with reference to the previous nonskipped frame; this can create an undesirable complexity in the real time application as well as introduce re-encoding error. A new frame-skipping transcoding architecture for improved picture quality and reduced complexity is proposed. The proposed architecture is mainly performed on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain to achieve a low complexity transcoder. It is observed that the re-encoding error is avoided at the frame-skipping transcoder when the strategy of direct summation of DCT coefficients is employed. By using the proposed frame-skipping transcoder and dynamically allocating more frames to the active participants in video combining, we are able to make more uniform peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance of the subsequences and the video qualities of the active subsequences can be improved significantly.\n",

            "Abstract: Recent advances in ubiquitous technologies facilitate context-aware systems which can offer situation-based services. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become increasingly important in recent years due to their ability to monitor and manage situational information for various intelligent services in ubiquitous environments. However, existing energy management systems are not effectively implemented in home and building environments due to their architectural limitations, such as static system architecture and a finite battery lifetime. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Self-adapting intelligent system used for providing building control and energy saving services in buildings. Our system consists of a gateway (selfadapting intelligent gateway) and a sensor (self-adapting intelligent sensor). In addition, we also propose an energy-efficiency self-clustering sensor network (ESSN) and a node type indicator based routing (NTIR) protocol that considers the requirements of WSNs, such as network lifetime and system resource management. In order to verify the efficiency of our system, we implemented our system in real test bed and conducted experiments. The results show that autonomous power saving using our system is approximately 16-24% depending on the number of SIS.\n",

It builds different representations of an image with a spatial resolution adapted to the size of objects of interest and to its level of relevance. Multiresolution analysis is an efficient tool for image segmentation. It allows the processing of global features as well as local features in a corresponding proper scale. Furthermore, it simplifies the segmentation process, accelerates the computation, and improves the results. In this work we propose a segmentation algorithm that is based on the multiresolution analysis for the magnetic resonance images of the human brain. It has been evaluated against known algorithm from the literature. The image subject to segmentation is preprocessed to be represented in a mosaic of different resolutions, based on the distribution of the information contained in the image. Then the conventional EM algorithm is applied for the segmentation.\n",

The original scheme provides an efficient and non-iterative method for designing the fastest freely rotatable gradient waveforms. Here, the hardware constraints are relaxed so that each axis is constrained independently. This produces the fastest possible non-rotatable waveforms that can be up to 10% faster than their previous counterparts. In addition, for circular trajectories we relax the path constraints. This results in new diamond-shaped trajectories, which are more optimized than circles for separable gradient sets, reducing the total travel time by up to an additional 11%. Analysis of performance for a variety of parameters including the sensitivity to field inhomogeneity compared to freely rotatable circle trajectories is presented.\n",

The approach used in the experiment starts with the formalization of the protocol at an abstract level. This model is then formally proved to fulfill the desired secrecy and authentication properties by using the ProVerif prover. Finally, a sound Java implementation is semi-automatically derived from the verified model using an enhanced version of the Spi2Java framework. The resulting implementation correctly interoperates with third party servers, and its execution time is comparable with that of other manually developed Java SSH-TLP client implementations. This case study demonstrates that the adopted model-driven approach is viable even for a real security protocol, despite the complexity of the models needed in order to achieve an interoperable implementation.\n",

            "Abstract: Considering a single-antenna M-user interference channel with symmetrically distributed channel gains, when the channel state information (CSI) is globally available, applying the ergodic interference alignment scheme, each transmitter-receiver pair achieves a rate proportional to ½ of a single user's interference-free achievable rate. This is substantially higher than the achievable rate of the conventional orthogonal transmission schemes such as TDMA. Since the rigid requirement on the CSI may be difficult to realize in practice, in this paper we investigate the performance of applying the ergodic interference alignment scheme when the estimation of each channel gain is made globally known through exploiting only a limited feedback signal from the associated receiver of that channel. Under a block fading environment, we provide a lower bound on the achievable average throughput of the network. Our results imply that the better performance of interference alignment over TDMA may still exist even without the assumption of perfect CSI. Also, the trade off between allocating feedback rate of each receiver to the desired channel or the interference channels at deferent SNR region investigated.\n",

Evaluation shows that, for robust path delay fault testing on ISCAS89/ ADDENDUM benchmark circuits, the TAT of Chiba scan testing with the proposed compaction is, on average, 47% and 21% shorter than that of Chiba scan testing without test compaction and that of enhanced scan testing with the conventional test compaction, respectively. In addition, in many cases, the fault coverage of the proposed testing is higher than that of launch-off-capture (LoC) and launch-off-shift (LoS) testing with the same TAT.\n",

Thus, it is important to design a publish/subscribe mechanism to enable such applications. Many existing solutions require that the sensor node locations be known, which is not possible for many sensor networks. Among those that do not require so, the common approach currently is to use an expensive gossip procedure to disseminate subscription queries and published events. We propose a solution that does not require location information yet aimed at better efficiency than the gossip-based approach.

The dynamical model incorporates several factors of locomotion derived from the biomechanical literature, including relative preferences for using some muscles more than others. elastic mechanisms at joints due to the mechanical properties of tendons, ligaments, and muscles, and variable stiffness at joints depending on the task. When used in a spacetime optimization framework, the parameters of this model define a wide range of styles of natural human movement.Due to the complexity of biological motion, these style parameters are too difficult to design by hand. To address this, we introduce Nonlinear Inverse Optimization, a novel algorithm for estimating optimization parameters from motion capture data. Our method can extract the physical parameters from a single short motion sequence. Once captured, this representation of style is extremely flexible: motions can be generated in the same style but performing different tasks, and styles may be edited to change the physical properties of the body.\n",

The stochastic binary system is viewed as an independence system. The algorithm finds a partition of the set of independence sets into subsets called intervals. If F ⊆ G, the interval between F and G is the collection of subsets F with F ⊆ F′ ⊆ G. The probability of an event corresponding to an interval is easy to calculate and the probability that the system operates is simply the sum of the event probabilities corresponding to the intervals in the partition. For any independence system a lower bound on the number of intervals needed in a partition is the number of bases. We show that for matroids this bound can be attained. Our algorithm finds a minimum cardinality interval partition of a matroid and characterizes matroids.\n",

            "Abstract: Multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) has become a promising candidate for future wireless multimedia communications for its robustness to frequency-selective fading and its flexibility in handling multiple data rates. Among different multirate access schemes, multicode MC-CDMA is attractive for its high performance, good flexibility in rate matching, and low complexity. However, its performance is limited by self-interference (SI) and multiuser interference (MUI). In this paper, a zero-forcing successive interference cancellation (ZF-SIC) receiver is used to mitigate this problem for multicode MC-CDMA. Furthermore, optimal power distribution control (PDC), which minimizes each user's bit error rate (BER), is considered. Our results show that, in correlated Rayleigh fading channels, the ZF-SIC receiver integrated with the optimal PDC dramatically improves the performance of the multicode MC-CDMA system in comparison with other receivers proposed in the literature. Moreover, the optimal PDC significantly outperforms the PDC based on equal BER criterion, particularly under a short-term transmit power constraint.\n",

The framework supports the collaborative development of ICM software applications by a group of ICM application developers from a library of software components. The framework focuses on the use of an explicit software development process to capture and disseminate specialized knowledge that augments the description of the ICM software application components in a library. The importance of preserving and using this knowledge has become apparent with the recent trend of combining the software development process with the software application code. There are three main components in the framework: design patterns, design rationale model, and intelligent search algorithms. Design patterns have been chosen to represent, record, and reuse the recurring design structures and associated design experience in object-oriented software development. The Design Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM) was extended in the current research effort to capture the specific implementation of reusable software components. DRIM provides a method by which design rationale from multiple ICM application designers can be partially generated, stored, and later retrieved by a computer system. To address the issues of retrieval, the paper presents a unique representation of a software component, and a search mechanism based on Reggia's setcover algorithm to retrieve a set of components that can be combined to get the required functionality is presented. This paper also details an initial, proof-of-concept prototype based on the framework. By supporting nonobtrusive capture as well as effective access of vital design rationale information regarding the ICM application development process, the framework described in this paper is expected to provide a strong information base for designing ICM software.\n",

            "Abstract: Conversational participants tend to immediately and unconsciously adapt to each other's language styles: a speaker will even adjust the number of articles and other function words in their next utterance in response to the number in their partner's immediately preceding utterance. This striking level of coordination is thought to have arisen as a way to achieve social goals, such as gaining approval or emphasizing difference in status. But has the adaptation mechanism become so deeply embedded in the language-generation process as to become a reflex? We argue that fictional dialogs offer a way to study this question, since authors create the conversations but don't receive the social benefits (rather, the imagined characters do). Indeed, we find significant coordination across many families of function words in our large movie-script corpus. We also report suggestive preliminary findings on the effects of gender and other features; e.g., surprisingly, for articles, on average, characters adapt more to females than to males.\n",

However, consistent methods to detect nonpersistence using electronic pharmacy records are presently lacking. We developed and validated a nonpersistence algorithm for chronically used medications.#N##N#Materials and Methods Refill patterns of adult diabetes patients (n = 14,349) prescribed cardiometabolic therapies were studied. We evaluated various grace periods (30-300 days) to identify medication nonpersistence, which is defined as a gap between refills that exceeds a threshold equal to the last days’ supply dispensed plus a grace period plus days of stockpiled medication. Since data on medication stockpiles are typically unavailable for ongoing users, we compared nonpersistence to rates calculated using algorithms that ignored stockpiles.#N##N#Results When using grace periods equal to or greater than the number of days’ supply dispensed (i.e., at least 100 days), this novel algorithm for medication nonpersistence gave consistent results whether or not it accounted for days of stockpiled medication. The agreement (Kappa coefficients) between nonpersistence rates using algorithms with versus without stockpiling improved with longer grace periods and ranged from 0.63 (for 30 days) to 0.98 (for a 300-day grace period).#N##N#Conclusions Our method has utility for health care operations and research in prevalent (ongoing) and new user cohorts. The algorithm detects a subset of patients with inadequate medication-taking behavior not identified as primary nonadherent or secondary nonadherent. Healthcare systems can most comprehensively identify patients with short- or long-term medication underutilization by identifying primary nonadherence, secondary nonadherence, and nonpersistence.\n",

The algorithm is based on the following three observations: (i) Semidefinite programs are linear programs with infinitely many (linear) constraints; (ii) every linear program can be solved by a sequence of constraint satisfaction problems with linear constraints; (iii) in general, the perceptron learning algorithm solves a constraint satisfaction problem with linear constraints in finitely many updates. Combining the PLA with a probabilistic rescaling algorithm (which, on average, increases the size of the feasable region) results in a probabilistic algorithm for solving SDPs that runs in polynomial time. We present preliminary results which demonstrate that the algorithm works, but is not competitive with state-of-the-art interior point methods.\n",

After determinization, the special symbols can be removed or replaced with e-transitions. The resulting transducer can be significantly more efficient to use. We report empirical results showing that our algorithm leads to a substantial speed-up in large-vocabulary speech recognition. Our pre-determinization algorithm makes use of an efficient algorithm for testing a general twins property, a sufficient condition for the determinizability of all weighted transducers over the tropical semiring and unambiguous weighted transducers over cancellative commutative semirings. Based on the transitions marked by this test of the twins property, our pre-determinization algorithm inserts new transitions just when needed to guarantee that the resulting transducer has the twins property and thus is determinizable. It also uses a single-source shortest-paths algorithm over the min-max semiring for carefully selecting the positions for insertion of new transitions to benefit from the subsequent application of determinization. These positions are proved to be optimal in a sense that we describe.\n",

Our Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the ability of the modified consensus/fusion based distributed implementation of the particle filter (MCF/DPF) to successfully handle intermittence in the network connectivity.\n",

HDL simulations of hardware models can help to find defects in the hardware design.

Hence it allows for software development to begin at an earlier stage of the manufacturing process and helps to decrease the time to market.

            "Abstract: This paper concerns the measurement-based comparison of urban microcellular mobile radio channel characteristics at 1.9 GHz and a higher frequency, i.e., 5.8 GHz, where future wireless systems could operate. Characteristics that are reported include transmission loss, root-mean-square delay spread, frequency correlation, and envelope fading statistics. Conclusions are drawn concerning whether significant differences in the performance of mobile radio links operating under the same signal-to-noise ratio conditions in the two bands would be expected in the area where the measurements were made\n",

            "Abstract: Wireless industrial sensor networks are necessary for industrial applications, so that wireless sensor nodes sense around themselves and detect anomaly events in the harsh industrial environments. Due to the harshness, anomaly events such as adversarial intrusions may result in harmful and disastrous situations for industrial applications but it is difficult to detect them over wireless medium. Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing. Throughout the experiments on the proposed framework, we stress the significance of one-hop clustering, which was neglected in the previous studies. Finally, we construct required logical protocols in the hierarchical framework; hierarchical intrusion detection and prevention protocols.\n",

            "Abstract: Overall efficiency of high-performance computing clusters not only relies on the computing power of the individual nodes, but also on the performance that the underlying network can provide to the computational application. Although modern high-performance networks, especially system area networks (SAN), have high unicast performance, they do not support multicast communication in hardware. This research experimentally evaluates the performance of various protocols for unicast-based and path-based multicast communication on high-speed torus networks. Software-based multicast performance results of selected algorithms on a 16-node Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) torus are given. The strengths and weaknesses of the various protocols are illustrated in terms of startup and completion latency, CPU utilization, and link utilization and concurrency.\n",

In this paper, we present a system that can accurately detect whether a student is gaming the system, within a Cognitive Tutor mathematics curricula. Our detector also distinguishes between two distinct types of gaming which are associated with different learning outcomes. We explore this detector's generalizability, and find that it transfers successfully to both new students and new tutor lessons.\n",

To further advance this area of clinical genomics one of the main challenges is the acquisition and integration of data, information and expert knowledge for specific biomedical domains and diseases. Currently the required information is not very well organized but scattered over biological and biomedical databases, basic text books, scientific literature and experts’ minds and may be highly specific, heterogeneous, complex and voluminous.#R##N##R##N#Results: We present a new framework to construct knowledge bases with concept maps for presentation of information and the web ontology language OWL for the representation of information. We demonstrate this framework through the construction of a peroxisomal knowledge base, which focuses on four key peroxisomal pathways and several related genetic disorders. All 155 concept maps in our knowledge base are linked to at least one other concept map, which allows the visualization of one big network of related pieces of information.#R##N##R##N#Availability: The peroxisome knowledge base is available from www.bioinformaticslaboratory.nl (Support → Web applications).#R##N##R##N#Contact: a.h.vankampen@amc.uva.nl#R##N##R##N#Supplementary information: Supplementary data is available from www.bioinformaticslaboratory.nl (Research → Output → Publications → KB_SuppInfo)\n",

            "Abstract: Classification cascades have been very effective for object detection. Such a cascade fails to perform well in data domains with variations in appearances that may not be captured in the training examples. This limited generalization severely restricts the domains for which they can be used effectively. A common approach to address this limitation is to train a new cascade of classifiers from scratch for each of the new domains. Building separate detectors for each of the different domains requires huge annotation and computational effort, making it not scalable to a large number of data domains. Here we present an algorithm for quickly adapting a pre-trained cascade of classifiers - using a small number of labeled positive instances from a different yet similar data domain. In our experiments with images of human babies and human-like characters from movies, we demonstrate that the adapted cascade significantly outperforms both of the original cascade and the one trained from scratch using the given training examples.\n",

            "Abstract: Auditability is a crucial aspect of distributed computing security. In a distributed computation environment, we may therefore want to prevent corrupt processes from denying or forging causal relationships between events. The audit of causal relationships of group multicast communications is an important component in achieving a solution to the problem of group-oriented distributed computing security. In this paper, a new approach to audit causal relationships of group multicast communications in group-oriented distributed systems is proposed. The goal of the auditing service is to collect, maintain, make available, and validate irrefutable evidence regarding causal relationships in group-oriented distributed systems. We affirm that the denial of existing causal relationships and the forgery of nonexistent causal relationships in group-oriented distributed systems can be correctly audited by our proposed approach. Also, auditing the causal delivery ordering for group multicast communications can actually be achieved. Moreover, we have validated the proposed auditing scheme to a moderately complex example. Experience indicates that the proposed scheme is indeed very useful.\n",

            "Abstract: Abstract#R##N##R##N#This study compares bibliometric indicators versus expert judgment as indicators of the research performance of major pharmaceutical companies, a context which may be uniquely capable of permitting such a comparison. For each company, a refined composite research output score was calculated based on that company's drug output (1965–1976). These research production scores, normalized by research budget as an indicator of research organizational size, produced an indicator of research productivity, an output/input ratio. The best and most consistent predictors of drug research success in general were the number of clinical articles, and in particular highly cited clinical articles—both their absolute value and their proportionate occurrence among publications. In general, there was a slight but consistent tendency for bibliometric indicators to perform better than expert judgments in predicting research performance as measured by a third and independent indicator of research output. This consistent trend was composed of three aspects. First, the subject-specific bibliometric indicators correlated more highly with the drug output performance measures than did general bibliometric measures or the expert judgments. Second, when the drug output measures were subjected to a regression analysis, the expert judgment variables were conspicuous by their absence, even in secondary or tertiary positions. Third, the expert judgment variables appeared to be very predictable from the bibliometric measures, while no such converse relationship existed.\n",

            "Abstract: Anti-virus systems developed by different vendors often demonstrate strong discrepancies in how they name malware, which signficantly hinders malware information sharing. While existing work has proposed a plethora of malware naming standards, most anti-virus vendors were reluctant to change their own naming conventions. In this paper we explore a new, more pragmatic alternative. We propose to exploit the correlation between malware naming of different anti-virus systems to create their consensus classification, through which these systems can share malware information without modifying their naming conventions. Specifically we present Latin, a novel classification integration framework leveraging the correspondence between participating anti-virus systems as reflected in heterogeneous information sources at instance-instance, instance-name, and name-name levels. We provide results from extensive experimental studies using real malware datasets and concrete use cases to verify the efficacy of Latin in supporting cross-system malware information sharing.\n",

            "Abstract: The passive calibration of the Radar Altimeter (RA) consists of characterizing the receiver gain by observing natural surfaces with known emission in the so-called noise-listen mode. It is based on the comparison between the simulated values of the brightness temperature impinging on the altimeter antenna, and the digital counts at the output of the altimeter receiver in the absence of echo. The proposed method aims to calibrate measurements of the backscattering coefficient performed by a spaceborne altimeter based on the assumption that the receiver gain is the main source of uncertainty. This paper focuses on the general approach undertaken to characterize the receiver and to simulate the brightness temperature at the top of the atmosphere observed by the Envisat RA-2. The simulations rely on emissivity models for land and sea, as well as on atmospheric radiation models supported by a continuous flow of online data used as model inputs. To assess the accuracy, the model outputs are compared with observations from calibrated radiometers, namely the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager, with particular attention to the low-frequency channels (10 and 19 GHz). The new method has been first tested on European Remote Sensing satellite data and has been subsequently adopted for Envisat RA-2 in the framework of the Envisat Calibration and Validation activities managed by European Space Agency. The evaluation of the receiver gain at both Ku-band and S-band is presented and compared to the preflight values, as well as to transponder calibration done for Ku-band. An error budget for the final estimates is also presented and discussed\n",

            "Abstract: The effect of rotor excitation voltage on steady-state stability and output power of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is investigated. Wind turbine mechanical torque-speed characteristics, as well as generator electromagnetic torque-speed characteristics, are considered in the derivation of the steady-state stability region for the magnitude and phase angle of the rotor excitation voltage. To evaluate the maximum output power of a DFIG, detailed expressions for stator power, rotor power, stator loss, rotor loss, and electrical power are derived as functions of the generator speed and the magnitude and phase angle of the rotor excitation voltage. The effect of stator resistance on the magnitude and phase angle of the resultant optimal rotor excitation voltage, which gives maximum output power and minimum loss, is examined. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.\n",

In this paper we introduce two methods, minAB and prodAB, to estimate joint probabilities. Both methods are based on a light-weight structure, partition support. The core idea is to maintain the partition support of itemsets over logically disjoint partitions and then use it to estimate joint probabilities of item-sets of higher cardinalitiess. We present extensive mathematical analyses on both methods and compare their performances on synthetic datasets. We also demonstrate a case study of using the estimation methods in Apriori algorithm for fast association mining. Moreover, we explore the usefulness of the estimation methods in other mining/learning tasks. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the estimation methods.\n",

            "Abstract: Opportunistic multicast schemes for time-sensitive stream traffic are studied for cellular networks where erasure coded packets are transmitted over discrete-time quasi-static forward-link fading channels. Assume that to successfully decode a transmitted stream fragment, it suffices that one receives k packets from the fragment. Two important issues are thus raised on when to stop transmitting a fragment and how to minimize the stopping time (ST) through transmission rate scheduling. Based on available channel state information and scheduled history, we tackle them particularly for small k required for short latency. If the distribution of IID channel states is available, the scheme is to compute and use the optimal constant transmission rate and minimum fixed ST subject to a reliability constraint. We show that the minimum ST grows with the logarithm of multicast group size. If channel state information is available, we propose to minimize random ST through selecting each optimal instantaneous transmission rate for a utility function. The utility function is specifically designed to exploit system transient states and dynamics. Results show that the scheme with an exponential weighted residual work achieves the least mean ST but the scheme maximizing instantaneous effective sum throughput has an edge of low complexity.\n",

            "Abstract: Sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMxV) is a core operation in many engineering, scientific and financial applications. Due to the sparse nature of the underlying matrices, irregular memory access patterns and short row lengths often slow down the performance significantly. Past implementations of SpMxV have been reported to be run at 10% or less of the machine's peak capability. In this paper we present a novel hardware support called distTree for efficient SpMxV. It is shown that replacing the column indices of sparse matrices with extra hardware is achievable and yields an average speedup by a factor of two for the suite of benchmarks used. The matrix data set for the distTree is approximately 30% less than that for conventional CSR algorithms so that distTree is beneficial in terms of not only performance but also memory usage. Thorough analysis is done by looking at the correlation between the performance speedups and various matrices properties.\n",

In this fashion, fewer transform coefficients are used and the synthesis process is simplified. We studied the design of fast inverses, for a given forward transform. General solutions are presented for M-channel finite impulse response (FIR) filterbanks, of which block and lapped transforms are a subset.

            "Abstract: In this paper, the class of generalized almost-cyclostationary (GACS) time series is introduced. Time series belonging to this class are characterized by multivariate statistical functions that are almost-periodic functions of time whose Fourier series expansions can exhibit coefficients and frequencies depending on the lag shifts of the time series. Moreover, the union over all the lag shifts of the lag-dependent frequency sets is not necessarily countable. Almost-cyclostationary (ACS) time series turn out to be the subclass of GACS time series for which the frequencies do not depend on the lag shifts and the union of the above-mentioned sets is countable. The higher order characterization of GACS time series in the strict and wide sense is provided. It is shown that the characterization in terms of cyclic moment and cumulant functions is inadequate for those GACS time series that are not ACS. Then, generalized cyclic moment and cumulant functions (in both the time and frequency domains) are introduced. Finally, the problem of estimating the introduced generalized cyclic statistics is addressed, and two examples of GACS time series are considered.\n",

The kernel supports objects as primitive entities and provides a communication mechanism that allows transparent distribution in networked systems. Fault tolerance is provided through replication and consistency-control mechanisms. MARUTI supports guaranteed-service scheduling, in which jobs that are accepted by the system are verified to satisfy general time constraints. These time constraints include those that govern interrupt processing, which allows the MARUTI approach to succeed where more rigorous approaches do not. The result is that MARUTI applications can be executed in a predictable, deterministic fashion. >\n",

            "Abstract: Although there have been much research on robot walking, the energy efficiency of central pattern generator (CPG)-based walking has not received much attention. This study proposes a novel method for acquiring energy-efficient CPG-based bipedal walking for a robot with knees and feet. In this method, we introduce a torque-free period for swing leg control into the swing leg control cycle. During this period, no torque is applied to the hip joint controller, and therefore no energy is consumed. When and for how long the torque-free period is inserted into the swing leg control cycle is adaptively acquired by reinforcement learning. Simulation experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our method. The energy consumed in acquiring walking is reduced by 40% compared with simple CPG-based walking without the torque-free period in the practical learning speed. Walking stability is maintained with respect to external disturbances on a level floor. Although the method is more unstable on slopes with the torque-free period, the torque-free-period can be adaptively eliminated to achieve stable walking on the slopes.\n",

The proposal tries to take advantage of the benefits of model-based controllers to improve the performance of control in anesthesia. The controller proposed is based on the application of two control actions. First, a nominal term is applied obtained from the inverse dynamics model. This action is corrected by adding a second term that compensates modeling errors, disturbances, etc. To compute the correction, a linearization of the model is considered around the nominal state and optimization is performed to compute the control action. Several results obtained in simulation are presented to test the efficiency of the method.\n",

A comparison between regression and rank preference models further supports our method. Experimental results on the first publically available dataset show that our system can achieve levels of performance close to the upper bound for the task, as defined by the agreement between human examiners on the same corpus.

This scheme relies on a simplified acquisition model of satellite images and uses continuous wavelet decompositions. We establish a correspondence between scales which permits us to compare wavelet decompositions of images having different resolutions. We validate the approach through several matching and classification experiments, and we show that taking the acquisition process into account yields better results than just using scaling properties of wavelet features.\n",

The results show that the order of local convergence is identical for Gaussian and spherical Cauchy distributions, whereas nonspherical Cauchy mutations lead to slower local convergence. As a by-product of the analysis, some recommendations for the parametrization of the self-adaptive step size control mechanism can be derived.\n",

We study an observable M/M/1 queue that serves an unknown proportion of patient and impatient customers. The provider has a Bernoulli prior on this proportion, corresponding to an optimistic or pessimistic scenario. For every queue length, she chooses a low or a high price, or turns customers away. Only the high price is informative. The optimal Bayesian price for a queue state is belief-dependent if the optimal policies for the underlying scenarios disagree at that queue state; in this case the policy has a belief-threshold structure. The optimal Bayesian pricing policy as a function of queue length has a zone (or, nested-threshold) structure. Moreover, the price convergence under the optimal Bayesian policy is sensitive to the system size, i.e., the maximum queue length. We identify two cases: prices converge (1) almost surely to the optimal prices in either scenario or (2) ...\n",

The NCO model on lattices and several complex networks displays a phase transition behavior, which is characterized by a large spanning cluster of nodes holding the same opinion appears when the initial fraction of nodes holding this opinion is above a certain critical value. In the NCO model, each agent will convert to its opposite opinion if there are more than half of agents holding the opposite opinion in its neighborhood. In this paper, we generalize the NCO model by assuming that each agent will change its opinion if the fraction of agents holding the opposite opinion in its neighborhood exceeds a threshold T (T ≥ 0.5). We call this generalized model as the NCOT model. We apply the NCOT model on different network structures and study the formation of opinion clusters. We find that the NCOT model on lattices displays a continuous phase transition. For random graphs and scale-free networks, the NCOT model shows a discontinuous phase transition when the threshold is small and the average degree of the network is large, while in other cases the NCOT model displays a continuous phase transition.\n",

            "Abstract: Surface task features are more salient than structural task features and thus easier to recognize for novices. It is predicted that the more salient the task features the better learners can choose personally relevant and varied tasks, which enhances learning transfer. To investigate this prediction, a 2x2 factorial experiment with 72 participants studied the effects of control over tasks that differ in their surface features (learner, program) and in their structural features (learner, program). Learner control over the selection of tasks with salient surface features enables learners to select personally relevant and varied tasks. This is believed to yield higher effectiveness (i.e., higher near and far transfer test performance) as well as higher efficiency (i.e., higher transfer test performance combined with lower associated mental effort). Learner control over the selection of tasks with non-salient structural features does not enable learners to select personally relevant and varied tasks and is therefore not expected to yield beneficial effects on learning. The results show positive effects of learner control over the selection of tasks with salient surface features for efficiency on the far transfer test but not for effectiveness. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n",

The demographic layer contains demographic factors of the person of concern; the cognitive layer contains factors related to the current search task (specifically, topics of interest and information goals) and users' cognitive ability to articulate their needs. The affective layer contains different affective motivations and intentions behind the search. The situational layer contains users' perceptions of the current health condition and where the person is in the illness trajectory. The social and environmental layer contains users' social roles, social norms, and various information channels. Several novel system functions, including faceted search and layered presentation of results, are proposed based on the model to help contextualize and improve users' interactions with health information systems.\n",

            "Abstract: Existing dynamic self-scheduling algorithms, used to schedule independent tasks on heterogeneous clusters, cannot handle tasks with dependencies because they lack the support for internode communication. To compensate for this deficiency we introduce a synchronization mechanism that provides inter-processor communication, thus, enabling self-scheduling algorithms to handle efficiently nested loops with dependencies. We also present a weighting mechanism that significantly improves the performance of dynamic self-scheduling algorithms. These algorithms divide the total number of tasks into chunks and assign them to processors. The weighting mechanism adapts the chunk sizes to the computing power and current run-queue state of the processors. The synchronization and weighting mechanisms are orthogonal, in the sense that they can simultaneously be applied to loops with dependencies. Thus, they broaden the application spectrum of dynamic self-scheduling algorithms and improve their performance. Extensive testing confirms the efficiency of the synchronization and weighting mechanisms and the significant improvement of the synchronized-weighted versions of the algorithms over the synchronized-only versions.\n",

            "Abstract: Bit allocation or the quantizer assignment problem is a basic and essential issue in lossy picture coding. The optimal solution for the bit allocation problem can be found by the Lagrangian method. However, it requires much computational time and memory. To reduce complexity overhead, we propose a fast scheme using a picture activity measure. Comparison among the existing activity measurement methods is presented to select the most reliable activity measure and the mapping relation between the activity value, and a quantization parameter is proposed.\n",

            "Abstract: The use of a Linear Periodic Controller (LPC) has been proposed as a new approach in the field of model reference adaptive control. The resulting controller can handle rapid changes in plant parameters, and it provides smooth transient behavior for a closed-loop system. Moreover, the LPC generates control signals, which are modes in size when measured using the infinity norm. Although the LPC has these advantages, it suffers from poor noise tolerance. The smaller the sampling time is the less noise tolerant the controller is. In this work, to alleviate this drawback, we apply a probing signal with a larger size. The probing size is inversely proportional to the sampling time. The proposed method has significantly better noise rejection but larger control signal.\n",

            "Abstract: The memory bandwidth reduction for motion estimation is important because of the power consumption and limited memory bandwidth in video coding systems. In this paper, we propose a Level C+ scheme which can fully reuse the overlapped searching region in the horizontal direction and partially reuse the overlapped searching region in the vertical direction to save more memory bandwidth compared to the Level C scheme. However, direct implementation of the Level C+ scheme may conflict with some important coding tools and then induces a lower hardware efficiency of video coding systems. Therefore, we propose n-stitched zigzag scan for the Level C+ scheme and discuss two types of 2-stitched zigzag scan for MPEG-4 and H.264 as examples. They can reduce memory bandwidth and solve the conflictions. When the specification is HDTV 720p, where the searching range is [-128,128), the required memory bandwidth is only 54%, and the increase of on-chip memory size is only 12% compared to those of traditional Level C data reuse scheme.\n",

In this paper, a variety of issues pertaining to the efficient Prolog implementation of groundness analysis are investigated, focusing on the domain of definite Boolean functions, Def. The systematic design of the representation of an abstract domain is discussed in relation to its impact on the algorithmic complexity of the domain operations; the most frequently called operations should be the most lightweight. This methodology is applied to Def, resulting in a new representation, together with new algorithms for its domain operations utilising previously unexploited properties of Def – for instance, quadratic-time entailment checking. The iteration strategy driving the analysis is also discussed and a simple, but very effective, optimisation of induced magic is described. The analysis can be implemented straightforwardly in Prolog and the use of a non-ground representation results in an efficient, scalable tool which does not require widening to be invoked, even on the largest benchmarks. An extensive experimental evaluation is given.\n",

We also prove that a slight variation of the AKKT condition is sufficient for a convex problem, either for variational inequalities or optimization. Sequential necessary conditions are more suitable to iterative methods than usual punctual conditions relying on constraint qualifications. The AKKT property holds at a solution independently of the fulfillment of a constraint qualification, but when a weak one holds, we can guarantee the validity of the KKT conditions.\n",

However, it is almost certain that autonomous systems in. Next generation networks will inadvertently include less than trustworthy components. Identifying such entities is critical to the smooth and effective functioning. We present new experiments conducted with the ROCQ scheme, a reputation-based trust management system that computes the trustworthiness of peers on the basis of transaction-based feedback. The ROCQ model combines four parameters: reputation (R) or a peer's global trust rating, opinion (O) formed by a peer's first-hand interactions, credibility (C) of a reporting peer and quality (Q) or the confidence a reporting peer puts on the feedback it provides. In this paper, we demonstrate that ROCQ is robust against churn and also examine the effect of credibility and quality on the performance of the scheme.\n",

We investigate the notion of CRS from a general perspective which is independent of the particular cost analysis framework. Our main contributions are: we provide a formal definition of execution cost and of CRS which is not tied to a particular programming language; we present the notion of sound CRS, i.e., which correctly approximates the cost of the corresponding program; we identify the differences with recurrence relation systems, its possible applications and the new challenges that they bring about. Our general framework is illustrated by instantiating it to cost analysis of Java bytecode, Haskell, and Prolog.\n",

Instead, researchers hope to use technology to make more efficient use of the highway network that already exists. Key efforts to date have fallen into two categories. One set of studies has looked at the use of a centralized traffic management center that collects traffic congestion information at a single point and relays it to on-board computers in vehicles or directly to the drivers. Another set of studies has looked at systems that would prescribe the routes for vehicles. The authors describe their Dicaf (distributed scalable architecture for IVHS using a continuous-function congestion measure) system, which envisions a network of distributed, independent traffic management centers that provide congestion and other information to on-board navigation systems in the automobiles themselves. The navigation system uses that information to help drivers avoid slower traffic and thus find the fastest route home or anywhere.\n",

We introduce a simple systematics and roadmap for ambient collaboration to identify opportunities and challenges unique to this class of computing.\n",

Given an N/spl times/N matrix A, the matrix powers problem is to calculate the first N powers of A, i.e., A, A/sup 2/A/sup 3/,..., A/sup N/.

Let p be arbitrarily chosen in the range 1/spl les/p/spl les/N/sup /spl alpha/+1//log N.

In this paper, we explore the geometric constraints to synthesize geometrically correct reflections. We also demonstrate how to constraint the synthesized reflections to be photometrically consistent with those in the original target views. The proposed method, therefore, advances the current image-based compositing techniques one step further toward the scenes with variations in both lighting conditions and viewpoints.

One of the main tasks of this work is the identification of an optimal edge threshold, i.e. the value of the luminance gradient allowing one to identify actual edge pixels. Such identification has been done by adopting a local approach, where the image is a-priori partitioned into small square windows, and the optimal threshold is selected by ranking the outputs produced by several thresholds inside each window. The innovative contributions of this work lie in the fact that, by partitioning the image in suitably small windows, the probability of having only one edge chain in each window is maximized (thus enhancing the effectiveness of the optimal threshold selection criterion), and the scalability of the application is ensured (due to the high number of simple processing tasks into which the algorithm is subdivided). >\n",

In next-generation home gateways, more services will be available (pay-per-view TV, games...) and different actors will provide them. When one service fails, it will be impossible to reboot the gateway without disturbing the other services. We propose a management framework that monitors remote gateways. The framework tests response times for various management activities on the gateway, and provides reference time/performance ratios. The values can be used to establish a management schedule that balances the rate at which queries can be performed with the resulting load that the query will induce locally on the gateway. This allows the manager to tune the ratio between the reactivity of monitoring and its intrusiveness on performance.\n",

Strand-specific reads allow for detection of antisense events and a higher resolution of expression profiles enabling extension of current transcript annotations. However, applications making use of this strandedness information are still scarce. Results: Here we present a tool (Janus), which focuses on the identification of transcriptional active regions in antisense orientation to known and novel transcribed elements of the genome. Janus can compare the antisense events of multiple samples and assigns scores to identify mutual expression of either transcript in a sense/ antisense pair, which could hint to regulatory mechanisms. Janus is able to make use of single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and methylation data, if available, and reports the sense to antisense ratio of regions in the vicinity of the identified genetic and epigenetic variation. Janus interrogates positions of heterozygous SNVs to identify strand-specific allelic imbalance.

To maintain the production yield at acceptable level, several levels of protection mechanisms will have to be implemented to tolerate the permanent and transient faults occurring in the physical layers. In this paper, we study fault tolerance at the architectural level in multiport processor grids (MPG) through core dual diagnosis and self-configuration of communications. MPGs are considered to ensure the scalability of future hundred-core chips. We characterize defective technologies by the IOP reachability (i.e., the ability of the IOPs to contact a fraction of cores in the grid) that we study as a function of the fraction of defective cores or links. We show that almost all valid cores in the grid are accessible by all input-output ports (IOP) up to approximately 20-25% of defective cores. This property is quasi-independent of the position of the IOPs in the grid.\n",

We observe that from a macroscopic level, human mobility is symmetric.

We show that this type of symmetry is more accentuated in synthetic mobility models, in particular, in random way-point mobility. We also study the direction of movement which also exhibits symmetric behavior in both real- as well as synthetic mobility. Additional contributions of our work include metrics to quantify mobility symmetry. We conclude the paper with a discussion of possible applications of our results in mobile networking.\n",

These measures, mainly computational effort and number of individuals to be processed, estimate the performance of the algorithm as well as the difficulty of a problem. Although Koza's performance measures have been widely used in the literature, their behaviour is not well known. In this paper we study the accuracy of these measures and advance in the understanding of the factors that influence them. In order to achieve this goal, we report an empirical study that attempts to systematically measure the effects of two variability sources in the estimation of the number of individuals to be processed and the computational effort. The results obtained in those experiments suggests that these measures, in common experimental setups, and under certain circumstances, might have a high relative error.\n",

Our sketch can also be viewed as a multidimensional generalization of the e-approximate quantile summary. The space complexity of our scheme is O((1/e) log R) if the points lie in the domain [0, R]d, where d is assumed to be a constant. The scheme extends to the sliding window model with a log (e n) factor increase in space, where n is the size of the sliding window. Our sketch can also be used to answer e-approximate rectangular range queries over a stream of d-dimensional points.\n",

            "Abstract: Motivated by a connection with the factorization of multivariate polynomials, we study integral convex polytopes and their integral decompositions in the sense of the Minkowski sum. We first show that deciding decomposability of integral polygons is NP-complete then present a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for decomposing polygons. For higher-dimensional polytopes, we give a heuristic algorithm which is based upon projections and uses randomization. Applications of our algorithms include absolute irreducibility testing and factorization of polynomials via their Newton polytopes.\n",

            "Abstract: Cluster based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been widely used for better performance in terms of energy efficiency. Efficient use of energy is challenging task of designing these protocols. Energy holed are created due to quickly drain the energy of a few nodes due to non-uniform distribution in the network. Normally, energy holes make the data routing failure when nodes transmit data back to the base station. We proposed Energy-efficient Hole Removing Mechanism (E-HORM) technique to remove energy holes. In this technique, we use sleep and awake mechanism for sensor nodes to save energy. This approach finds the maximum distance node to calculate the maximum energy for data transmission. We considered it as a threshold energy Eth. Every node first checks its energy level for data transmission. If the energy level is less than Eth, it cannot transmit data. We also explain mathematically the energy consumption and average energy saving of sensor nodes in each round. Extensive simulations showed that when use this approach for WSNs significantly helps to extend the network lifetime and stability period.\n",

            "Abstract: In healthcare acceleration sensors have various applications in monitoring movements for prevention, diagnostics, therapy and rehabilitation. Unfortunately they react sensitive against changes of environmental conditions and therefore it is necessary to calibrate them from time to time. This paper introduces a technique for automatic self-calibration of body worn triaxial-accelerometers that do neither need any user interaction nor a special calibration procedure. The data are calibrated automatically during operation of the sensor. The method does not require any knowledge about the actual orientation of the sensor and uses the activity of the subject to calibrate, because the activity is the region of interest for evaluation. The error of the automatic self-calibration will be as small as the error of common techniques for calibration that need an additional procedure, whereby an important error source will be excluded. The resulting algorithm is so small and compact, that it can even be transferred onto a sensor system and executed by its microprocessor.\n",

A preliminary research model is presented for helping the consequent replication of the study. The results from the empirical analysis suggest Kanban can be an effective method in visualizing and organizing the current work, but does not prevent waste from creeping in, although the overall project outcome may be successful.\n",

            "Abstract: It is important for us to measure the features of various information models (IMs), because it will give us the opportunity to distinguish which models that are more complicated than others. With this measure it is also possible to estimate for example, the lines of code in the implemented product and the cost and time effort needed to make the product. It is also possible to discover which parts of the model that are most complex and thereby know which part that will need the most time to implement. The IM Meter is able to measure the significant properties of various information models such as complexity and information content. The measures the IM Meter deals with are of various sorts. Some of them measure the features of minor details of the information models while other measure more general and extending properties. The present paper considers telecommunications management network (TMN) interface complexity in particular.\n",

Therefore, medical informatics has become an extensive field of research and many of these approaches have demonstrated potential value for improving medical quality. The aim of this study was to develop a web-based cardiovascular clinical information system (CIS) based on innovative techniques, such as electronic medical records, electronic registries and automatic feature surveillance schemes, to provide effective tools and support for clinical care, decision-making, biomedical research and training activities. The CIS developed for this study contained monitoring, surveillance and model construction functions. The monitoring layer function provided a visual user interface. At the surveillance and model construction layers, we explored the application of model construction and intelligent prognosis to aid in making preoperative and postoperative predictions. With the use of the CIS, surgeons can provide reasonable conclusions and explanations in uncertain environments.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper we describe a method that estimates the motion of a calibrated camera (settled on an experimental vehicle) and the tridimensional geometry of the environment. The only data used is a video input. In fact, interest points are tracked and matched between frames at video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are computed in real-time, key-frames are selected and permit the features 3D reconstruction. The algorithm is particularly appropriate to the reconstruction of long images sequences thanks to the introduction of a fast and local bundle adjustment method that ensures both good accuracy and consistency of the estimated camera poses along the sequence. It also largely reduces computational complexity compared to a global bundle adjustment. Experiments on real data were carried out to evaluate speed and robustness of the method for a sequence of about one kilometer long. Results are also compared to the ground truth measured with a differential GPS.\n",

At present, it is difficult for XQuery to type and optimize structurally recursive queries because of polymorphic recursive functions involved in the queries.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we propose a new technique called structural function inlining which inlines recursive functions used in a query by making good use of available type information. Based on the technique, we develop a new approach to typing and optimizing structurally recursive queries. The new approach yields a more precise result type for a query. Furthermore, it produces an optimal algebraic expression for the query with respect to the type information. When a structurally recursive query is applied to non-recursive XML data, our approach translates the query into a finitely nested iterations.#R##N##R##N#We conducted several experiments with commonly used real-life and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that the number of node lookups by our approach is on the average 3.7 times and up to 279.8 times smaller than that by the XQuery core's current approach in evaluating structurally recursive queries.\n",

            "Abstract: Social coding enables a different experience of software development as the activities and interests of one developer are easily advertised to other developers. Developers can thus track the activities relevant to various projects in one umbrella site. Such a major change in collaborative software development makes an investigation of networkings on social coding sites valuable. Furthermore, project hosting platforms promoting this development paradigm have been thriving, among which GitHub has arguably gained the most momentum. In this paper, we contribute to the body of knowledge on social coding by investigating the network structure of social coding in GitHub. We collect 100,000 projects and 30,000 developers from GitHub, construct developer-developer and project-project relationship graphs, and compute various characteristics of the graphs. We then identify influential developers and projects on this sub network of GitHub by using PageRank. Understanding how developers and projects are actually related to each other on a social coding site is the first step towards building tool supports to aid social programmers in performing their tasks more efficiently.\n",

As the design of effective network architectures is a key issue to achieve energy-efficient and low-latency communications between the on-body sensors, the 1-hop star and the 2-hop extended star architectures have recently been promoted by the IEEE 802.15.6 task group (TG6) as ideal candidates for WBSNs. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the topology dynamics and the performance of routing strategies in WBSNs using time-variant channel measurements at $2.45GHz$. We aim at better understanding the impact of human body shadowing on the performance of network and routing architectures, in terms of delivery ratio, latency and energy consumption. We finally provide guidelines and recommendations for the design and implementation of effective and practical WBSNs architectures.\n",

In archeology the determination of the exact volume of arbitrary vessels is of importance since this provides information about the manufacturer and the usage of the vessel. To acquire the 3d shape of objects with handles is complicated, since occlusions of the object's surface are introduced by the handle and can only be resolved by taking multiple views. Therefore, the 3d reconstruction is based on a sequence of images of the object taken from different viewpoints with two different algorithms; shape from silhouette and shape from structured light. The output of both algorithms are then used to construct a single 3d model. Results of the algorithm developed are presented for both synthetic and real input images.\n",

The results presented are based on questionnaires and interviews conducted with senior managers responsible for strategic planning in the banks. It was found that information is viewed as a source of competitive advantage in this sector, but that the 'formalised' information gathering process was ad hoc. Typical information sources were viewed as of secondary importance, i.e. online databases, journals, CD-ROMs. Managers preferred to commission external information, such as PEST (political, environmental, social and technological) analyses, and to rely upon internally-generated information from colleagues. Performance analysis models, such as the balanced scorecard, helped companies to confront information problems, but blockages in the flow of customer information were acknowledged.\n",

            "Abstract: Server applications augmented with behavioral adaptation logic can react to environmental changes, creating self-managing server applications with improved quality of service at runtime. However, developing adaptive server applications is challenging due to the complexity of the underlying server technologies and highly dynamic application environments. This paper presents an architecture framework, the Adaptive Server Framework (ASF), to facilitate the development of adaptive behavior for legacy server applications. ASF provides a clear separation between the implementation of adaptive behavior and the business logic of the server application. This means a server application can be extended with programmable adaptive features through the definition and implementation of control components defined in ASF. Furthermore, ASF is a lightweight architecture in that it incurs low CPU overhead and memory usage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ASF through a case study, in which a server application dynamically determines the resolution and quality to scale an image based on the load of the server and network connection speed. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the performance gains possible by adaptive behavior and the low overhead introduced by ASF. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

The multiple model structure serves to treat the observability and the state estimation problem of nonlinear systems. Using a method with no information loss, a nonlinear system is transformed into a multiple model, depending on the choice of premise variables. It is a key point, since it allows to choose, between different multiple model forms, the one that has suitable structure and properties, in order to design an observer. The convergence conditions of the state estimation error are expressed in LMI formulation using the Lyapunov method. These proposals are investigated and applied to the three-tank system.\n",

Fluxnet-Canada is a national research network developed to study the influence of climate and disturbance on terrestrial carbon cycling along an east-west transect of Canadian forest and peatlands. The purpose of the present work was to create large-area land cover classifications from satellite imagery to support Fluxnet scaling and modeling studies. The methodology presented in Cihlar et al. (2003) was implemented on seven Fluxnet monitoring sites across Canada. A Landsat ETM+ image covering each site was clustered to 1501 classes using unsupervised K-Means classification prior to 50-cluster merging through classification by generalization (CPG). The resulting clusters were merged to 16-class landcover maps through interactive labeling using cluster bitmaps to create spatial context for the 50 clusters. The bitmaps aided the analyst when ground data was scarce or nonexistent. The products were sent to Fluxnet-Canada site managers for ground validation and the classifications were refined according to the feedback provided. The final landcover maps were used in the calculation of leaf area index (LAI) for the Landsat ETM+ scenes, thus allowing for upscaling of carbon flux measurements based on the correlation of LAI to carbon flux.\n",

In this paper we propose a new technique to model the impulse response of the 60 Ghz channel. This new approach is based on the spectral analysis of alpha-stable processes. Our new model present many advantages: firstly, the channel is characterized only by a one deterministic function(spectral density) in the place of four parameters. Secondly, the estimations procedure deals directly with the measured transfer functions which avoids loosing information in data pretreatment. Finally, an estimation of the spectral measure permits to directly generate the impulse response.\n",

            "Abstract: Several applications benefited from multicast data distribution because a sender can concurrently transmit data to multiple receivers using fewer bandwidth. However, reliability is an important issue in multicast because retransmission is not very efficient in multicast. In recent years, Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes are proposed to facilitate reliable multicast data distribution and are applied to several applications. FEC provides a more efficient way of reliable multicast data distribution because of no retransmission. In this paper, we propose a new FEC codes (F-CR codes), which are extended from Chinese Remainder codes, require smaller transmission redundancy than conventional FEC codes and support two variants for transmission and computation efficiency. In particular, the r-decomposition variant allows the sender to decompose an output symbols encoded into r smaller sub-symbols. This decomposable property which is firstly proposed in this paper is especially suitable for link unstable networks or link heterogeneity networks like wireless sensor networks. The analysis and experiments also demonstrate the feasibility of F-CR codes.\n",

            "Abstract: Topological thinning is a valid but time-consuming method to calculate the centerline of human colon or other hollow organs accurately. An optimized 3D topological thinning method based on Look-up Table (LUT), which was proposed by Sadlier, proves to be effective in improving the efficiency on many occasions. However, it is still inefficient when processing some complex datasets. In this paper, we first analyze the reason causing the unstable performance, and then present an extension to Sadlier's method, which enables the rapid execution of the extraneous loops removing by avoiding unnecessary global connectivity testing. To reach this purpose, a min-heap structure is introduced to select a seed from the candidate voxels set of the final centerline, and region growing technique is used to find the voxels in the same branch with the seed. The comparison among the standard topological thinning, LUT method and the extension to LUT method indicates the extension achieves the most efficient performance.\n",

The high-granularity switched speech and audio coder AMR-WB+ performs especially well for speech and mixed content by promptly adapting its coding model scheme to the signal. However, the high adaptation rate is done at the price of limited performance for non-speech signals. The aim of the paper is to enhance the coding efficiency of AMR-WB+ while maintaining its high flexibility. For this purpose, the original DFT was replaced by the state-of-art transformation MDCT, and the vector quantization by the combination of a scalar quantization and an evolved context-adaptive arithmetic coder.

            "Abstract: Millimeter-wave radiometric measurements obtained from the NASA ER-2 aircraft over the arctic region on May 20, 1998, were used to estimate precipitable water (PW) in the range/spl les/0.60 g/cm/sup 2/. The approach is a modified version of the recent work by J. Miao (1998), which utilized the radiometric measurements at 150, 183.3/spl plusmn/3, and 183.3/spl plusmn/7 GHz of the SSM/T-2 sensor to retrieve PW over the antarctic region. However, Miao has implicitly assumed a surface emissivity that is frequency independent over the 150-183 GHz range. This assumption turns out not to be a good one based on the airborne measurements described below and the errors introduced in the PW estimation were substantial in many cases. It is shown below that four-frequency radiometric measurements in the frequency range of 150-220 GHz provided a robust retrieval of PW, while allowing for a surface emissivity that varied linearly with frequency. The retrieved PW compared favorably with that calculated from rawinsonde data at two widely separated locations. The differences between the retrieved and calculated values are not more than /spl plusmn/0.02 g/cm/sup 2/, which is smaller than errors associated with measurement uncertainty. It is found necessary to account for the double side-band nature of the 183.3 GHz measurements in the radiative transfer calculations for development of the retrieval algorithm. The PW values estimated from the algorithm developed from single side band, 183.3 GHz radiative transfer calculations could be in error by as much as /spl plusmn/0.10 g/cm/sup 2/. Finally, the effect of surface temperature variations is shown to introduce only a small error in the estimation of PW.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel low complexity two-stage minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based receiver for single carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) for space-time block coded (STBC) transmissions over frequency selective channels. We demonstrate that the proposed receiver enjoys a remarkably simple decoding scheme. We further show that, by incorporating linear processing techniques, our MMSE-based receiver is able to collect full antenna and multipath diversity gains, while maintaining low complexity, thus, eliminating the need for maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD), which has certainly prohibitive complexity, specially, when the constellation size of the transmitted signals and/or the block length increases. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed receiver significantly outperforms the conventional SC-MMSEFDE receiver, while maintaining nearly similar complexity.\n",

            "Abstract: Variable bit rate (VBR) compressed video is expected to become one of the major loading factors in high-speed packet networks such as ATM-based B-ISDN. However, recent measurements based on long empirical traces (complete movies) revealed that VBR video traffic possesses  self-similar  (or  fractal ) characteristics, meaning that the dependence in the traffic stream lasts much longer than traditional models can capture.In this paper, we present a unified approach which, in addition to accurately modeling the marginal distribution of empirical video records, also models directly  both  the short and the long-term empirical autocorrelation structures. We also present simulation results using synthetic data and compare with results based on empirical video traces.Furthermore, we extend the application of efficient estimation techniques based on  importance sampling  that we had used before only for simple fractal processes. We use importance sampling techniques to efficiently estimate low probabilities of packet losses that occur when a multiplexer is fed with synthetic traffic from our self-similar VBR video model.\n",

            "Abstract: Population rate models provide powerful tools for investigating the principles that underlie the cooperative function of large neuronal systems. However, biophysical interpretations of these models have been ambiguous. Hence, their applicability to real neuronal systems and their experimental validation have been severely limited. In this work, we show that conductance-based models of large cortical neuronal networks can be described by simplified rate models, provided that the network state does not possess a high degree of synchrony. We first derive a precise mapping between the parameters of the rate equations and those of the conductance-based network models for time-independent inputs. This mapping is based on the assumption that the effect of increasing the cell's input conductance on its f-I curve is mainly subtractive. This assumption is confirmed by a single compartment Hodgkin-Huxley type model with a transient potassium A-current. This approach is applied to the study of a network model of a hypercolumn in primary visual cortex. We also explore extensions of the rate model to the dynamic domain by studying the firing-rate response of our conductance-based neuron to time-dependent noisy inputs. We show that the dynamics of this response can be approximated by a time-dependent second-order differential equation. This phenomenological single-cell rate model is used to calculate the response of a conductance-based network to time-dependent inputs.\n",

For modeling erasures and random errors, the occurrence of new time-varying features is introduced in the analysis to characterize the behavior of memory systems for space applications (using Reed-Solomon codes as EDAC). Moreover, differently from existing techniques, the nature of these features (such as scrubbing and the effects of the so-called South Atlantic Anomaly on SEU rates) is assessed using a deterministic framework.\n",

            "Abstract: Multiple faults in a program may interact with each other in a variety of ways. A test case that fails due to a fault may not fail when another fault is added, because the second fault may mask the failure-causing effect of the first fault. Multiple faults may also collectively cause failure on a test case that does not fail due to any single fault alone. Many studies try to perform fault localization on multi-fault programs and several of them seek to match a failed test to its causative fault. It is therefore, important to better understand the interference between faults in a multi-fault program, as an improper assumption about test case failure may lead to an incorrect matching of failed test to fault, which may in turn result in poor fault localization. This paper investigates such interference and examines if one form of interference holds more often than another, and uniformly across all conditions. Empirical studies on the Siemens suite suggest that no one form of interference holds unconditionally and that observation of failure masking is a more frequent event than observation of a new test case failure.\n",

            "Abstract: In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), a rendezvous between two nodes exists when they tune to the same channel simultaneously. Rendezvous guarantee between any pair of nodes is essential because a rendezvous is a necessary condition for a communication. Several existing works claim that such a guarantee can be provided by using a dedicated common control channel for channel negotiation. A serious problem of these mechanisms is that a globally available channel may not exist. Some channel hopping protocols try to provide rendezvous guarantee without using a common control channel. However, these solutions may suffer from low number of rendezvous and uneven channel utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed channel hopping protocol called Quorum and Latin Squares Channel Hopping, QLCH. QLCH efficiently provides rendezvous guarantee by utilizing the concept of quorum systems and latin squares. The former is utilized to guarantee rendezvous while the latter is adopted to share the rendezvous among channels. Simulation results verify that the proposed QLCH protocol performs better in terms of network throughput and time to rendezvous when compared to existing protocols, L-QCH, ACH, and SYNC-ETCH.\n",

            "Abstract: Views and their updates have long been a fundamental technology required in a wide range of applications. However, it has been known that updates through views is a classical intractable problem. In this paper, we propose a novel,  data-oriented  approach to this problem that provides a  practical support  for view updates. In particular, we propose a summarization of the source database of views, which serves as an  update filter . The update filter aims to efficiently reject untranslatable view updates by  estimating the side effects  of the updates, thereby avoiding costly translation analysis. For applications where estimation errors are not preferred, our update filter can be tuned to be exact. In this paper, we present our approach with SPJ views, an important class of view definitions. We first revise the notion of estimation errors to quantify the filter’s qualities. We then propose a novel  join cardinality summary  ( JCard ) derived from cardinality equivalence. An estimation algorithm is proposed. Finally, we present optimizations enabling the construction of an accurate  JCard  through heuristics and sampling. Our extensive experiments show that update filters are efficient and can be easily tuned to produce accurate estimations on TPC-H and DBLP.\n",

Towards that end, we present here a novel methodology to identify the semantic structures inherent in an arbitrary semantic graph dataset. We first present the concept of an extant ontology as a statistical description of the semantic relations present amongst the typed entities modeled in the graph. This serves as a model of the underlying semantic structure to aid in discovery and visualization. We then describe a method of ontological scaling in which the ontology is employed as a hierarchical scaling filter to infer different resolution levels at which the graph structures are to be viewed or analyzed. We illustrate these methods on three large and publicly available semantic datasets containing more than one billion edges each.\n",

            "Abstract: A cellular system where macrocells are overlaid with femtocells is studied. Each femtocell is served by a home base station (HBS) that is connected to the macrocell base station (BS) via an unreliable network access link, such as DSL followed by the Internet. A scenario with a single macrocell and a single femtocell is considered first, and is then extended to include multiple macrocells and femtocells, both with standard single-cell processing and with multicell processing (or network MIMO). Two main issues are addressed for the uplink channel: (i) Interference management between femto and macrocells; (ii) Robustness to uncertainties on the quality of the femtocell (HBSto-BS) access link. The problem is formulated in information-theoretic terms, and inner and outer bounds are derived to achievable per-cell sum-rates for outdoor and home users. Expected sum-rates with respect to the distribution of the femtocells access link states are studied as well. Overall, the analysis lends evidence to the performance advantages of sophisticated interference management techniques, based on joint decoding and relaying, and of robust coding strategies via the broadcast coding approach (i.e., unequal error protection).\n",

The system accepts triangular meshes, but tolerates degenerated polygons, disconnected component, and other anomalies. As the feature vector, the method uses a combination of three vectors, (1) the moment of inertia, (2) the average distance of surface from the axis, and (3) the variance of distance of the surface from the axis. Values in each vector are discretely parameterized along each of the three principal axes of inertia of the model. We employed the Euclidean distance and the elastic-matching distance as the measures of distance between pairs of feature vectors. Experiments showed that the proposed shape features and distance measures perform fairly well in retrieving models having similar shape from a database of VRML models.\n",

As a cornerstone technology for digital information delivery, data broadcast provides a strong backbone for the digital ecosystem infrastructure. Its scalability feature is highly significant for various digital ecosystem applications, including mobile broadcast services. This paper proposes a novel structure and access for mobile data broadcast. The proposed scheme addresses the tradeoff for minimizing query-access and tuning times by specifying a new message structure. Correspondingly, a new access and processing mode for mobile clients is required. We study the effectiveness of the proposed approach in minimizing query-access time while maintaining low tuning time. The results of our experiments are used to make comparisons with existing approaches. The results affirm the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.\n",

With Interactive Steering, the user may change the state of a computation by adjusting application parameters on-the-fly. In our system, we model both the programs execution and steering actions in terms of transactions. We define a steering transaction as consistent if its vector time is not concurrent with the vector time of any program transaction. That is, consistent steering transactions occur \"between\" program transactions, at a point that represents a consistent cut. In this paper, we present an algorithm for verifying the consistency of steering transactions. The algorithm analyzes a record of the program transactions and compares it against the steering transaction; if the time at which the steering transaction was applied is inconsistent, the algorithm generates a vector representing the earliest consistent time at which the steering transaction could have been applied.\n",

This endeavor is the maintenance of several applications on one terminal: Radio bearers have restrictions in the quality of service (QoS) for applications due to limited resources. And the cell setup for the execution of several mobile applications may lead to unacceptable waiting periods for the user. As example considers WAP access, where the connection to the gateway takes, in general, approximately half a minute. This period increases if one is using several applications on one mobile terminal. Another hinderance is an insufficient QoS availability during the call setup. Here, the execution of the mobile application is shutdown.

We show how to address three key challenges. First, we demonstrate a manageable access control system based on attributes. Second we show how this can be used with existing messaging systems to provide a practical deployment strategy. Third, we show that such a system can be efficient enough to support ABM for mid-size enterprises.

Our data structure, which shares some similarity with Bregman Ball Trees, consists of a hierarchical partition of a database, and uses a novel branch and bound methodology for search. The main technical contribution of the paper is a novel and efcient algorithm for deciding whether to explore nodes during backtracking, based on a variational approximation. This reduces the number of computations per node, and overcomes the limitations of Bregman Ball Trees on high dimensional data. In addition, our strategy is applicable also to probability distributions with hidden state variables, and is not limited to regular exponential family distributions. Experiments demonstrate substantial speedups over both Bregman Ball Trees and over brute force search, on both moderate and high dimensional histogram data. In addition, experiments on linear dynamical systems demonstrate the exibility of our approach to latent variable models.\n",

When extended to multi robotic scenarios where all robots possess more than one hypothesis of their position, there is the opportunity to do better by using robots apart from obstacles as 'hypotheses resolving agents'. The demo here showcases a unified framework accounting for the map structure as well as measurement amongst robots while guiding a set of robots to positions where they can localize to a unique state. Another aspect of framework demonstrates the idea of dispatching localized robots to locations where they can assist a maximum of the remaining unlocalized robots to overcome their ambiguity. The method presented has been tested in both simulation and real-time on robots and its efficacy verified.\n",

Topic driven crawlers can complement search engines because they pre-classify the pages retrieved by the crawl. To implement such a focused crawler, a strategy for ordering the crawl frontier is required. Such a strategy can only use information gleaned from previously crawled pages to estimate the relevance of a newly observed URL. Because the best strategy for ranking URLs in the crawl frontier is not immediately apparent, we discover strategies by evolving them using a genetic algorithm. Strategies are learned by evaluating the results of crawls simulated using a database generated by a previous, more general crawl. We conclude that a rank function that combines analysis of text and link structure yields effective strategies. The evolved strategies perform better than the commonly used Best First strategy.\n",

            "Abstract: The field of information visualization is in permanent expansion and new and innovative ways of visualizing large volumes of abstract data are being developed. The use of virtual metaphoric worlds is one of them, but these visualizations per se are only truly useful if the user is provided a means of exploring the information. A common way of data exploration is navigation. In the case of three-dimensional (3D) information visualization, navigation as a means of information exploration attains even more importance due to the extra exploitable dimension. Nonetheless, navigation in large virtual worlds is still a difficult task and not only for naive users; there is anecdotal evidence that electronic navigation is considered difficult even by the virtual worlds builders. Wayfinding, knowing where to go, is sometimes perceived as the hardest part; other times, it is the locomotion, getting there, that is found difficult. This paper presents a navigation strategy that attempts to solve these problems by combining physical/metaphoric navigation with semantic navigation. We present a framework for navigating large virtual worlds that relies heavily on the use of visual metaphors. The combination of physical and semantic navigation embedded in the metaphor components allows for a powerful data exploration and electronic navigation mechanism.© (2002) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Second, we proposed an adaptive phase stepping method to alleviate the color coupling errors efficiently and improve accuracy effectively.

Our final objective is to test applications using a wide range of architectures (real or merely designed) and scaling it to any number of nodes or components. This paper presents a new simulation framework, called SIMCAN, for HPC architectures. The main characteristic of the proposed simulation framework is the ability to be configured for simulating a wide range of possible architectures that involve any number of components. SIMCAN is developed to simulate complete HPC architectures, but putting special emphasis on the storage and network subsystems. The SIMCAN framework can handle complete components (nodes, racks, switches, routers, etc.), but also key elements of the storage and network subsystems (disks, caches, sockets, file systems, schedulers, etc.). We also propose several methods to implement the behavior of HPC applications. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks. In order to evaluate the possibilities and the accuracy of the SIMCAN framework, we have tested it by executing a HPC application called BIPS3D on a hardware-based computing cluster and on a modeled environment that represent the real cluster. We also checked the scalability of the application using this kind of architecture by simulating the same application with an increased number of computing nodes.\n",

A number of sensor nodes are scattered within a sensitive region to detect the presence of intruders and forward subsequent events to the analysis center(s). Obviously, the sensor deployment should guarantee an optimal event detection rate.      This paper proposes a tracking framework based on Voronoi tessellations. Two mobility models are proposed to control the coverage degree according to target presence. The objective is to set a non-uniform coverage within the monitored zone to allow detecting the target(s) by multiple sensor nodes. We show how the proposed algorithm adapts to the situation where multiple targets move in the monitored zone. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm to discover redundant nodes (which do not provide additional information about target position). This algorithm is shown to be effective in reducing the energy consumption using an activity scheduling approach. Simulations are carried out to underline the efficiency of the proposed models.\n",

            "Abstract: Pathway Logic is an application of techniques from formal methods to the modeling and analysis of signal transduction networks in mammalian cells. These signaling network models are developed using Maude, a symbolic language founded on rewriting logic. Network elements (reactions) are represented as rewrite rules. Models can be queried (analyzed) using the execution, search and model-checking tools of the Maude system. Collections of rules and initial states of interest form a novel kind of database where a biologist can record results of both curation and experiments.\n",

            "Abstract: Unlike existing single-stage AC/DC converters with uncontrolled intermediate bus voltage, a new single-stage AC/DC converter achieving power factor correction (PFC), intermediate bus voltage output regulation, and output voltage regulation is proposed. The single-power-stage circuit is formed by integrating a boost PFC converter with a two-switch-clamped forward converter. The current stress of the main power switches is reduced due to separated conduction period of the two source currents flowing through the power switch. A dual-loop peak-current-mode controller is proposed to achieve PFC and ensure independent bus voltage and output voltage regulations. Experimental results on a 24-V/100-W hardware prototype are given to confirm the theoretical analysis and performance of the proposed converter. The converter has conversion efficiency ranging from 86% to 92% at full-load condition.\n",

            "Abstract: A 5-bit 500-MS/s time-domain flash ADC is presented. The proposed ADC consists of a reference resistor ladder, two voltage-to-time converter arrays, a time-domain comparator array and a digital encoder without sample-and-hold. In order to achieve low-power consumption with high conversion-speed and to enhance design reusability in terms of a highly digital implementation with more regular mask patterns, the time-domain comparison is devised in the flash ADC. The prototype has been implemented and fabricated in a standard 0.18 μm CMOS technology and occupies 0.132 mm2 without pads. The measured SNDR and SFDR up to the Nyquist frequency are 26.6 dB and 35.1 dB, respectively. And the peak DNL and INL are measured as 0.43 LSB and 0.58 LSB, respectively. The prototype consumes 8 mW with a 1.8-V supply voltage.\n",

            "Abstract: A three-level inverter produces six active vectors, each of normalized magnitudes 1, 0.866, and 0.5, besides a zero vector. The vectors of relative length 0.5 are termed pivot vectors. The three nearest voltage vectors are usually used to synthesize the reference vector. In most continuous pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) schemes, the switching sequence begins from a pivot vector and ends with the same pivot vector. Thus, the pivot vector is applied twice in a subcycle or half-carrier cycle. This paper proposes and investigates alternative switching sequences, which use the pivot vector only once but employ one of the other two vectors twice within the subcycle. The total harmonic distortion (THD) in the fundamental line current pertaining to these novel sequences is studied theoretically as well as experimentally over the whole range of modulation. Compared with centered space vector PWM, two of the proposed sequences lead to reduced THD at high modulation indices at a given average switching frequency.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we present a methodology to obtain a channel description tailored on performance evaluation for incremental redundancy hybrid automatic repeat request schemes. Such techniques counteract channel errors by using data coding and transmitting parts of the codeword over different channel realizations. We focus on coding performance models where the error probability is asymptotically zero if the channel parameters of these realizations fall within a given region. To map this region in a compact but still precise manner, we adopt a finite-state channel model. This approach is quite common in the literature; however, differently from existing work, we propose a novel method to derive efficient channel partitioning rules, i.e., a code-matched quantization of the channel state. Such a representation enables the use of accurate Markov models to study the system performance. Compared to existing channel representation methods, our proposed technique leads to a more accurate evaluation of higher layer statistics while at the same time keeping the computational complexity low.\n",

            "Abstract: Next Generation wireless networks are evolving towards all-data system which are expected to support a variety of application services with diverse transmission rates. Meanwhile, since most of the mobile terminals in wireless networks are battery-powered, to use energy efficiently, each terminal needs to transmit just enough power to achieve the desired transmission rate without causing excessive interference in the network. In this paper, a game-theoretic framework is used to study the joint power and rate control problem on the energy efficiency of wireless data network. A energy-efficient non-cooperative joint power and rate control game is thus introduced in which each user seeks to choose its possible transmit power and transmission rate in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its target SINR as quality-of service (QoS) requirement. The utility function here we adopt is especially suitable for energy-constrained networks. We introduce pricing of transmit power into the utility function which not only improves the overall system performance, but also obtains Pareto Improvement when compared to the game with no pricing. The existence, uniqueness, best-response strategies and Pareto efficiency of Nash Equilibrium for the proposed game are proved. Based on these analysis, we present a distributive joint power and rate control algorithm. In the simulation part, we investigate the best pricing factor and compare our proposed algorithm with alternative algorithms developed by using game theory.\n",

            "Abstract: STiki is an anti-vandalism tool for Wikipedia. Unlike similar tools, STiki does not rely on natural language processing (NLP) over the article or  diff  text to locate vandalism. Instead, STiki leverages spatio-temporal properties of revision metadata. The feasibility of utilizing such properties was demonstrated in our prior work, which found they perform comparably to NLP-efforts while being more efficient, robust to evasion, and language independent.   STiki is a real-time, on-Wikipedia implementation based on these properties. It consists of, (1) a server-side processing engine that examines revisions, scoring the likelihood each is vandalism, and, (2) a client-side GUI that presents likely vandalism to end-users for definitive classification (and if necessary, reversion on Wikipedia). Our demonstration will provide an introduction to spatio-temporal properties, demonstrate the STiki software, and discuss alternative research uses for the open-source code.\n",

For medical applications, the toolkits currently available focus on image analysis and volume rendering. Advanced interactive visualizations and user interface issues are not adequately supported.

The METK is based on the rapid prototyping platform MeVisLab and offers a large variety of facilities for an easy and efficient application development process. We present dedicated techniques for advanced medical visualizations, exploration, standardized documentation, and interface widgets for common tasks. These include, e.g., advanced animation facilities, viewpoint selection, several illustrative rendering techniques, and new techniques for object selection in 3D surface models. No extended programming skills are needed for application building, since a graphical programming approach can be used.

            "Abstract: The resource-based view has been proposed to investigate the impact of information technology (IT) investments on firm performance. Researchers have shown that a firm's ability to effectively leverage its IT investments by developing a strong IT capability can result in improved firm performance. We test the robustness of this approach and examine several related issues. Our results indicate that firms with superior IT capability indeed exhibit superior current and sustained firm performance when compared to average industry performance, even after adjusting for effects of prior firm performance. However, the differences in the results from various analyses suggest that the impact of \"halo effects\" and prior financial performance of firms must be taken into consideration in future tests of IT capability. Further, it is critical to develop theoretically derived multidimensional measures of IT capability in order to continue to apply the RBV approach to assess the impact of IT investments on firm performance.\n",

In contrast to previous works we consider the most general class of segmentation combination, i.e. each input segmentation has an arbitrary number of regions. Our approach is based on a random walker segmentation algorithm which is able to provide high-quality segmentation starting from manually specified seeds. We automatically generate such seeds from an input segmentation ensemble. An information-theoretic optimality criterion is proposed to automatically determine the final number of regions. The experimental results on 300 images with manual ground truth segmentation clearly show the effectiveness of our combination approach.\n",

In this paper we present the first statistical analysis performed on this graph, with the goal of checking whether the information contained in the graph is reliable (i.e. whether it depends essentially on appearance and disappearance of pages and links, or on the crawler behaviour). We perform a number of tests that show that the graph is actually reliable, and provide the first public data on the evolution of the Web that use a large scale and a significant diversity in the sites considered.\n",

            "Abstract: Defining a membership value (mv) for the strings of a fuzzy grammar/language and the calculation of this mv have been important issues since the inception of fuzzy automata and fuzzy languages. Some researchers have tried to calculate the mv of strings, by developing deterministic (Moore) automata which are equivalent to fuzzy automata (fuzzy languages) in terms of the accepted language. This approach is usually time demanding and becomes impractical for large fuzzy grammars and languages. In this paper, we will show how the newly developed paradigm of general fuzzy automata (GFA) solves this problem very elegantly and directly, by removing the burden of generating deterministic acceptors to calculate the mv's of the strings belonging to a fuzzy language.\n",

            "Abstract: The performance of software-based verification strategies is not keeping up with the increasing complexity of modern system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Therefore modular prototyping platforms are proposed to validate SoC designs. Most of these platforms consist of real processors combined with programmable logic, e.g. FPGA, that communicate through a board-level interconnect system. Usually, the programmable logic and the interconnect system do not run at the target clock speed of the future design. Hence, the emulated processes of the prototyping platform have to be synchronized to provide an accurate system validation. Most synchronization concepts are only able to synchronize the process data flows if data is time-independent. In this paper we present an event-based prototyping platform consisting of real processors combined with FPGAs. This platform emulates events with cycle accuracy, even though the processes operate in different scaled clock domains. Therefore we are able to validate time-dependent data flows.\n",

The authors describe an algorithm paradigm for the joint design of the feature codebooks constituting a GPC.

            "Abstract: Using the  ns-2 -simulator to experiment with different aspects of user- or session-behaviors and network configurations and focusing on the qualitative aspects of a wavelet-based scaling analysis, we present a systematic investigation into how and why variability and feedback-control contribute to the intriguing scaling properties observed in actual Internet traces (as our benchmark data, we use measured Internet traffic from an ISP). We illustrate how variability of both user aspects and network environments (i) causes self-similar scaling behavior over large time scales, (ii) determines a more or less pronounced change in scaling behavior around a specific time scale, and (iii) sets the stage for the emergence of surprisingly rich scaling dynamics over small time scales; i.e., multifractal scaling. Moreover, our scaling analyses indicate whether or not open-loop controls such as UDP or closed-loop controls such as TCP impact the local or small-scale behavior of the traffic and how they contribute to the observed multifractal nature of measured Internet traffic. In fact, our findings suggest an initial physical explanation for why measured Internet traffic over small time scales is highly complex and suggest novel ways for detecting and identifying, for example, performance bottlenecks.This paper focuses on the qualitative aspects of a wavelet-based scaling analysis rather than on the quantitative use for which it was originally designed. We demonstrate how the presented techniques can be used for analyzing a wide range of different kinds of network-related measurements in ways that were not previously feasible. We show that scaling analysis has the ability to extract relevant information about the time-scale dynamics of Internet traffic, thereby, we hope, making these techniques available to a larger segment of the networking research community.\n",

Caterpillar developed the dealers' parts inventory sharing (DPIS) and returns programs to help dealers cope with excess inventory.

In this project, we develop alternative returns policies and propose to use simulation to analyze the cost structure of the alternative policies, develop cost sharing schemes, and compare performance with the current policy under different scenarios. It is shown that the simulation tool we developed provides industry managers with a test ground for new returns strategies and the output analysis presents guidelines to set parameters when using the new strategies to manage returns distribution.\n",

            "Abstract: Breast cancer diagnosis may be improved by electrical immittance measurements. We have developed a novel method, space-frequency MUItiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), to determine three-dimensional positions and electrical parameters of focal lesions from multifrequency trans-admittance data recorded with a planar electrode array. A homogeneous infinite volume conductor containing focal inhomogeneities proved to be a useful patient-independent model for the breast containing focal lesions. Lesions polarized through the externally applied electric field are considered as distributions of aligned dipoles. Independence of the lesions' shape and size is achieved by a multipole expansion of such a dipole distribution. Thus, lesions are described by point-like multipoles. Their admittance contributions are given by a sum over products of multipole-specific source-sensor transfer functions, called lead fields, multiplied by their moments. Lesion localization corresponds to multipole search, and uses orthonormalized lead fields for comparison with a signal subspace from a singular value analysis of a space-frequency data matrix. At the locations found, the moments' frequency behavior is calculated which is assumed to be tissue-specific due to their dependence on conductivities. Results from clinical data show that space-frequency MUSIC successfully localizes lesions. Tissue differentiation might be possible, especially when the frequency range of the measurement system will be increased.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we propose an automatic approach, complete with a prototype system, for supporting instant access to maps for local navigation by people with visual impairment. The approach first detects and segments texts from a map image and recreates the remaining graphical parts in a tactile form which can be reproduced immediately through a tactile printer. Then, it generates an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file, which integrates both text and graphical information. The tactile hardcopy and the SVG file together are used to provide a user with interactive access to the map image through a touchpad, resulting in a tactile-audio representation of the original input image. This supports real-time access to the map without tedious conversion by a sighted professional. Evaluations with six users who are blind show that the created tactile-audio maps from our prototype system convey the most important map information and are deemed as potentially useful for local navigation.\n",

The system has different predefined interfaces according to end-user characteristics, but the users can tailor the final appearance of the information to be showed by the system. From these different adaptations, tailored by users, the system tries to find similarities that can result in a modification of the default interface that is presented to new users of the system. The new interface could be distinct from the one constructed by the original interface designer.\n",

This scheme is rooted in a Source/Filter decomposition of the sound where the filter is described as a set of poles and the source is described as a set of impulses representing the energy transfer between the interacting objects. Compared to single impacts, sustained contact interactions like rolling and sliding make the estimation of the parameters of the Source/Filter model challenging because of two issues. First, the objects are almost continuously interacting. The second is that the source is generally unknown and has therefore to be modeled in a generic way. In an attempt to tackle those issues, the proposed analysis/synthesis scheme combines advanced analysis techniques for the estimation of the filter parameters and a flexible model of the source. It allows the modeling of a wide range of sounds. Examples are presented for objects of various shapes and sizes, rolling or sliding over plates of different materials. In order to demonstrate the versatility of the approach, the system is also considered for the modeling of sounds produced by percussive musical instruments.\n",

Although the MLP-based framework can handle any features derived from a multitude of sources, choosing all possible features may lead to over complex models and hence less generality. In this paper, we design an extensive set of features and analyze their contribution to STD individually and as a group. The main goal is to choose a small set of features that are suciently informative while keeping the model simple and generalizable. We employ two established models to conduct the analysis: one is linear regression which targets for the most relevant features and the other is logistic linear regression which targets for the most discriminative features. We nd the most informative features are comprised of those derived from diverse sources (ASR decoding, duration and lexical properties) and the two models deliver highly consistent feature ranks. STD experiments on both English and Spanish data demonstrate signicant performance gains with the proposed feature sets.\n",

This limits the ability of Service-based Application (SBA) developers to configure and syndicate offerings from multiple SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS providers to address their application requirements. Furthermore, combining different independent cloud services necessitates a uniform description format that facilitates the design, customization, and composition. Cloud Blueprinting is a novel approach that allows SBA developers to easily design, configure and deploy virtual SBA payloads on virtual machines and resource pools on the cloud. We propose the Blueprint concept as a uniform abstract description for cloud service offerings that may cross different cloud computing layers, i.e., SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. To support developers with the SBA design and development in the cloud, this paper introduces a formal Blueprint Template for unambiguously describing a blueprint, as well as a Blueprint Lifecycle that guides developers through the manipulation, composition and deployment of different blueprints for an SBA. Finally, the empirical evaluation of the blueprinting approach within an EC’s FP7 project is reported and an associated blueprint prototype implementation is presented.\n",

We consider Diffserv networks able to support real-time traffic and we propose a novel framework for admission control that involves both traffic descriptor and measurement-based techniques and we compare its performance with existing approaches. Our simulation results show that the performance of our approach is rather insensitive to variations of the traffic sources. Even when the provided traffic descriptors are as simple as a single value denoting the required peak rate, the proposed scheme achieves satisfactory performance.\n",

However, in real life, games are often played in certain contexts where players are constrained by their capabilities, law, culture, custom, and so on. For example, if someone wants to drive a car, he/she has to have a driving license. Therefore, when a human player of a game chooses a strategy, he/she should consider not only the material payoff or monetary reward from taking his/her best strategy and others' best responses but also how feasible to take the strategy in that context where the game is played. To solve such a game, this paper establishes a model of fuzzily constrained games and introduces a solution concept of constrained equilibrium for the games of this kind. Our model is consistent with psychological experiment results of ultimatum games. We also discuss what will happen if Prisoner's Dilemma and Stag Hunt are played under fuzzy constraints. In general, after putting constraints into account, our model can reflect well the human behaviors of fairness, altruism, self-interest, and so on, and thus can predict the outcomes of some games more accurate than conventional game theory.\n",

            "Abstract: We consider the radio allocation problem for multi- radio multi-channel cognitive wireless networks, i.e., the optimal placement of radios within the network to maximize the network utility function. This problem is formulated as a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem. We derive the necessary conditions that the optimal solution should satisfy, and then develop a sequential optimization scheme to solve this problem. Simulation studies are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed radio allocation framework. It is seen that the proposed approach can significantly enhance the overall network performance. I. INTRODUCTION\n",

            "Abstract: Most studies of plans and situated work have applied ethnographic methods and and thus fail to provide any quantitative insight into the extent of this phenomenon. We present a study of planning and executing operations in an operating suite. Quantitative analysis of log data reveals the extent to which operation schedules are carried out as planned, and qualitative studies reveal the reasons behind changes to the plan, the consequences of such changes, and the strategies used to cope with them. 67% of the plan is changed and only 56% of all operations are planned ahead. We discuss how operation schedules are subject to \"continuous planning\", and how this needs to be supported by technology.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper proposes the evolutionary generation of an artificial creature's personality by using the concept of multi-objective optimization. The artificial creature has its own genome and in which each chromosome consists of many genes that contribute to defining its personality. The large number of genes allows for a highly complex system, however it becomes increasingly difficult and time-consuming to ensure reliability, variability and consistency for the artificial creature's personality while manually assigning gene values for the individual genome. Moreover, there needs user's preference to obtain artificial creature's personality by using evolutionary generation. Preference is strongly depend on each user and most of them would have difficulty to define their preference as a fitness function. To solve this problem, this paper proposes multi-objective generating process of an artificial creature's personality. Genome set is evolved by applying strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA). To facilitate the individuality of generated artificial creature, complement of (1-k) dominance and pruning method considering deviation are proposed. Obtained genomes are tested by using an artificial creature, Rity in the virtual 3D world created in a PC.\n",

            "Abstract: Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of speeding up functional (delay-independent) logic simulation for synchronous digital systems. The problem needs very little new motivation-cycle-based functional simulation is the largest consumer of computing cycles in system design. Most existing simulators for this task can he classified as being either event driven or levelized compiled-code, with the levelized compiled code simulators generally being considered faster for this task. An alternative technique, based on evaluation using branching programs, was suggested about a decade ago in the context of switch level functional simulation. However, this had very limited application since it could not handle the large circuits encountered in practice. This paper resurrects the basic idea present this technique and provides significant modifications that enable its application to contemporary industrial strength circuits. We present experimental results that demonstrate up to a 10X speedup over levelized compiled code simulation for a large suite of benchmark circuits as well as for industrial examples with over 40.000 gates.\n",

            "Abstract: This paper describes a novel type of single-carrier DS-CDMA system that combines the use of OFDM-style cyclic prefixes with frequency-domain equalization, for use on the forward link of broadband CDMA cellular systems. The proposed method is referred to as CP-CDMA. The combination of cyclic prefixes and MMSE frequency-domain equalization solves many of the performance and complexity problems that arise in CDMA receivers when techniques such as multi-level modulation and full code usage are employed. Simulation results are presented for a 20 MHz system with multi-level modulation and these results are compared to the performance of a conventional CDMA system with either a RAKE receiver or a time-domain equalizer. Results indicate that CP-CDMA provides significantly improved performance, yet has lower complexity than the time-domain equalized system.\n",

            "Abstract: Centering around anticipative and reactive capabilities of firms, accurate response is an important supply-side strategy to deal with demand uncertainty. Clearly, the structure of the possible reaction will crucially influence the optimal anticipative decision making. In this article, we extend the existing literature in this area by including a new reactive capability, namely the utilization of refurbished consumer returns from early sales to react to demand later in the selling season. Because consumer returns depend on previous sales, there is also a direct link to the anticipative supply decision. We capture this effect in a newsvendor-type model and provide both analytical and numerical insights into the optimal anticipative and reactive decisions as well as the value of refurbishing in terms of the retailer's expected profitability.\n",

            "Abstract: A solar-aided coal-fired power plant realizes the integration of a fossil fuel (coal or gas) and clean energy (solar). In this paper, a conventional 600 MW coal-fired power plant and a 600 MW solar-aided coal-fired power plant have been taken as the study case to understand the merits of solar-aided power generation (SAPG) technology. The plants in the case study have been analyzed by using the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics principles. The solar irradiation and load ratio have been considered in the analysis. We conclude that if the solar irradiation was 925 W/m 2 and load ratio of the SAPG plant was 100%, the exergy efficiency would be 44.54% and the energy efficiency of the plant (46.35%). It was found that in the SAPG plant the largest exergy loss was from the boiler, which accounted for about 76.74% of the total loss. When the load ratio of the unit remains at 100%, and the solar irradiation varies from 500 W/m 2 to 1,100 W/m 2 , the coal savings would be in the range of 8.6 g/kWh to 15.8 g/kWh. If the solar irradiation were kept at 925 W/m 2 while the load ratio of the plant changed from 30% to 100%, the coal savings could be in the range of 11.99 g/kWh to 13.75 g/kWh.\n",

The longitudinal (vertical) and latitudinal (horizontal) directions of our model are decoupled and processed separately, and later combined to generate the final cloth.

We show that this reconstruction procedure naturally leads to the definition of a signal characteristic scale. We also focus on signal approximation from the multiscale extrema representation of one of its derivatives. Numerical applications involve the use of the signal characteristic scale for transient estimation and also the study of the new signal approximation method we propose\n",

            "Abstract: The performance of the selection diversity combiner is studied. Unlike most previous works where perfect knowledge of the signal amplitude and the noise power is assumed, in this analysis, knowledge of the signal amplitude and the noise power is obtained by using practical estimators that introduce estimation errors. The average symbol error rate of the combiner is derived for non-coherent M-ary frequency shift keying signals, independent and non-identically distributed diversity branches and unequal noise powers. The effect of estimation errors on the performance of the combiner is evaluated and illustrated by numerical examples. An interesting and useful conclusion is that it is disadvantageous to employ signal-to-noise ratio as a branch selection criterion when the branch noise powers are known a priori to be equal.\n",

First, we analyze detailed thermo-mechanical stress induced by TSVs in conjunction with various associated structures such as landing pad and dielectric liner. Then, we explore and validate the use of the linear superposition principle of stress tensors and demonstrate the accuracy of this method against detailed finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. Next, we apply this linear superposition method to full-chip stress simulation and a reliability metric named the von Mises yield criterion. Finally, we propose a design optimization methodology to mitigate the mechanical reliability problems in 3D ICs. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology.\n",

Gibson's precomputational theory eschewed any explicit representation. In contrast, Marr used layers of explicit representation, hoping to simplify vision computations. Current technological advances in robotic hardware and computer architectures have allowed the building of anthropomorphic devices that capture important technical features of human vision. Experience with these devices suggests that cooperative sensorimotor behaviors can reduce the need for explicit representation. This view is captured in the notion of “animate vision,” which is a framework for sequential decision-making, gaze control, and visual learning.\n",

            "Abstract: Multi-objective meta-heuristics permit to conceive a complete novel approach to induce classifiers, where the properties of the rules can be expressed in different objectives, and then the algorithm finds these rules in an unique run by exploring Pareto dominance concepts. Furthermore, these rules can be used as an unordered classifier, in this way, the rules are more intuitive and easier to understand because they can be interpreted independently one of the other. This work describes a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm that handles with numerical and discrete attributes. The algorithm is evaluated by using the area under ROC curve and comparing the performance of the induced classifiers with other ones obtained with well known rule induction algorithms. The approximation sets produced by the algorithm are also analyzed following multi-objective methodology.\n",

            "Abstract: Use of simulation tools for industrial projects implies a need for aligning the engineering process and simulation modeling activities. Alignment of activities builds on the definition of a conceptual model, detailing modeling objectives, model contents, inputs and outputs, thereby relying on a project problem definition and candidate solutions. Modeling frameworks assist the analyst in defining conceptual models by identifying relevant activities to undertake, as well as suggesting good practices, and supportive methods. Surprisingly, current frameworks do not acknowledge the need for explicitly linking the set-up of a conceptual model to the engineering process. Hence, both project efficiency and effectiveness may be hurt. To address this gap, we propose an integrated conceptual modeling framework, which is tailored towards simulation use for logistic analysis purposes. Relevance of the integrated framework for project success is illustrated by a case example.\n",

A basic property of Gallai-colorings with at least three colors is that at least one of the color classes must span a disconnected graph. We are interested here in whether this or a similar property remains true if we consider colorings that do not contain a rainbow copy of a fixed graph F. We show that such graphs F are very close to bipartite graphs, namely, they can be made bipartite by the removal of at most one edge. We also extend Gallai's property for two infinite families and show that it also holds when F is a path with at most six vertices.\n",

            "Abstract: In this paper, we define a number of tools that we think belong to the core of any toolkit for requirements engineers. The tools are conceptual and hence, they need precise definitions that lay down as exactly as possible what their meaning and possible use is. We argue that this definition can best be achieved by a formal specification of the tool. This means that for each semi-formal requirements engineering tool we should provide a formal specification that precisely specifies its meaning. We argue that this mutually enhances the formal and semi-formal technique: it makes formal techniques more usable and, as we will argue, at the same time simplifies the diagram-based notations.#R##N##R##N#At the same time, we believe that the tools of the requirements engineer should, where possible, resemble the familiar semi-formal specification techniques used in practice today. In order to achieve this, we should search existing requirements specification techniques to look for a common kernel of familiar semi-formal techniques and try to provide a formalisation for these.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we illustrate this approach by a formal analysis of the Shlaer-Mellor method for object-oriented requirements specification. The formal specification language used in this analysis is LCM, a language based on dynamic logic, but similar results would have been achieved by means of another language. We analyse the techniques used in the information model, state model, process model and communication model of the Shlaer-Mellor method, identify ambiguities and redundancies, indicate how these can be eliminated and propose a formalisation of the result. We conclude with a listing of the tools extracted from the Shlaer-Mellor method that we can add to a toolkit that in addition contains LCM as formal specification technique.\n",

            "Abstract: In recent years, various network virtualization techniques have been proposed for flexibly supporting heterogeneous services over virtual network platforms. However, systematic views on how virtual network resources (VNRs) can be practically managed in such open environments has been missing till now. To fill the gap, we present in this article a two-dimensional architecture for end-to-end VNR management from distinct viewpoints of service providers and network providers. The horizontal dimension of VNR management allows SPs to bind VNRs rented from heterogeneous NPs to form unified end-to-end service delivery platforms. The vertical dimension of VNR management enables NPs to perform cost-efficient allocation of VNRs to requesting SPs, but without necessarily forcing themselves to collaborate with each other. Such a VNR management architecture will complement existing network virtualization platforms in accelerating the realization of virtual resource sharing in the future Internet business marketplaces.\n",

Compared with traditional clustering algorithms, consensus clustering approaches have the ability to integrate multiple partitions from different cluster solutions to improve the robustness, stability, scalability and parallelization of the clustering algorithms. By consensus clustering, one can discover the underlying classes of the samples in gene expression data.#R##N##R##N#Results: In addition to exploring a graph-based consensus clustering (GCC) algorithm to estimate the underlying classes of the samples in microarray data, we also design a new validation index to determine the number of classes in microarray data. To our knowledge, this is the first time in which GCC is applied to class discovery for microarray data. Given a pre specified maximum number of classes (denoted as Kmax in this article), our algorithm can discover the true number of classes for the samples in microarray data according to a new cluster validation index called the Modified Rand Index. Experiments on gene expression data indicate that our new algorithm can (i) outperform most of the existing algorithms, (ii) identify the number of classes correctly in real cancer datasets, and (iii) discover the classes of samples with biological meaning.#R##N##R##N#Availability: Matlab source code for the GCC algorithm is available upon request from Zhiwen Yu.#R##N##R##N#Contact:yuzhiwen@cs.cityu.edu.hk and cshswong@cityu.edu.hk#R##N##R##N#Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n",

Observations of the user's behavior can provide training examples that a machine learning system can use to form a model designed to predict future actions. However, user modeling poses a number of challenges for machine learning that have hindered its application in user modeling, including: the need for large data sets; the need for labeled data; concept drift; and computational complexity. This paper examines each of these issues and reviews approaches to resolving them.\",\n          \"As is well known in statistics, the resulting linear regressors by using the rank-based Wilcoxon approach to linear regression problems are usually robust against (or insensitive to) outliers. This motivates us to introduce in this paper the Wilcoxon approach to the area of machine learning. Specifically, we investigate four new learning machines, namely Wilcoxon neural network (WNN), Wilcoxon generalized radial basis function network (WGRBFN), Wilcoxon fuzzy neural network (WFNN), and kernel-based Wilcoxon regressor (KWR). These provide alternative learning machines when faced with general nonlinear learning problems. Simple weights updating rules based on gradient descent will be derived. Some numerical examples will be provided to compare the robustness against outliers for various learning machines. Simulation results show that the Wilcoxon learning machines proposed in this paper have good robustness against outliers. We firmly believe that the Wilcoxon approach will provide a promising methodology for many machine learning problems.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning\",\n          \"Unknown\",\n          \"Computer Science - General\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.06140207269115991,\n        \"min\": 0.48623267621320354,\n        \"max\": 0.6781974342406851,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5141248680447533,\n          0.5096506515838638,\n          0.6781974342406851\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In this article, we review the major approaches to machine learning in symbolic domains, covering the tasks of learning concepts from examples, learning search methods, conceptual clustering, and language acquisition. We illustrate each of the basic approaches with paradigmatic examples. (Author)\",\n          \"As is well known in statistics, the resulting linear regressors by using the rank-based Wilcoxon approach to linear regression problems are usually robust against (or insensitive to) outliers. This motivates us to introduce in this paper the Wilcoxon approach to the area of machine learning. Specifically, we investigate four new learning machines, namely Wilcoxon neural network (WNN), Wilcoxon generalized radial basis function network (WGRBFN), Wilcoxon fuzzy neural network (WFNN), and kernel-based Wilcoxon regressor (KWR). These provide alternative learning machines when faced with general nonlinear learning problems. Simple weights updating rules based on gradient descent will be derived. Some numerical examples will be provided to compare the robustness against outliers for various learning machines. Simulation results show that the Wilcoxon learning machines proposed in this paper have good robustness against outliers. We firmly believe that the Wilcoxon approach will provide a promising methodology for many machine learning problems.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Unfortunately, there is no state-of-art approach to carrying out information security evaluation in a systematic way. Information security evaluation of software-intensive and telecommunications systems typically relies heavily on the experience of the security professionals. Requirements are within the focus of the information security evaluation process. Information security requirements can be based on iterative risk, threat and vulnerability analyses, and technical and architectural information. There is a need for more practical ways to carry out this iterative process. In this paper we discuss security evaluation process, security objectives and security requirements from the basis of the experiences of a security testing project\",\n          \"In today's applications, most users disregard the security functionality. They do not have the knowledge and/or the motivation to configure or to use the existing security functions correctly. In this paper, we present a new concept to improve the usability of security mechanisms, introducing an extended classification of protection goals. As a result, the everyday use of security functionality can be reduced to selecting the user's identity, which is the basis of the Identity-Manager, a new security tool presented in this paper. It offers a user interface for security functionality that is compatible with all Internet applications, so even inexperienced users are able to configure and negotiate their security needs in a convenient way.\",\n          \"There is a plethora of different security standards proposed by a range of standards consortia, including the IETF, W3C, and OASIS. There are also sometimes multiple configuration settings for a given security specification. In a heterogeneous open service environment, the variety of security standards and possible settings used can hinder security interoperability, because a common security configuration may not be able to be agreed upon in advance. In this paper, we have developed a generic security model expressed in an XML extension (DAML) and have investigated how to ground this in order to reuse the security specifications from various standards consortia. We have applied this model to support security discovery and dynamic security reconfiguration for use within open service infrastructures.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Computer Science - General\",\n          \"Networking & Communications\",\n          \"Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.021139244672145417,\n        \"min\": 0.7217719903829116,\n        \"max\": 0.7683835473321337,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.760475124608241,\n          0.7217719903829116,\n          0.748198605027998\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In this article, we review the major approaches to machine learning in symbolic domains, covering the tasks of learning concepts from examples, learning search methods, conceptual clustering, and language acquisition. We illustrate each of the basic approaches with paradigmatic examples. (Author)\",\n          \"As is well known in statistics, the resulting linear regressors by using the rank-based Wilcoxon approach to linear regression problems are usually robust against (or insensitive to) outliers. This motivates us to introduce in this paper the Wilcoxon approach to the area of machine learning. Specifically, we investigate four new learning machines, namely Wilcoxon neural network (WNN), Wilcoxon generalized radial basis function network (WGRBFN), Wilcoxon fuzzy neural network (WFNN), and kernel-based Wilcoxon regressor (KWR). These provide alternative learning machines when faced with general nonlinear learning problems. Simple weights updating rules based on gradient descent will be derived. Some numerical examples will be provided to compare the robustness against outliers for various learning machines. Simulation results show that the Wilcoxon learning machines proposed in this paper have good robustness against outliers. We firmly believe that the Wilcoxon approach will provide a promising methodology for many machine learning problems.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"similarity_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.04002554994272562,\n        \"min\": 0.5884098328687142,\n        \"max\": 0.6910169777113322,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6762972089728927\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Amongst several impediments, one is a lack of professional recognition of scientific data publishing efforts. A possible solution is establishment of a \\u2018Data Publishing Framework\\u2019 which would encourage and recognise investments and efforts by institutions and individuals towards management, and publishing of primary scientific data potentially on a par with recognitions received for scholarly publications. Discussion: This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of primary biodiversity data publishing, and conceptualises a \\u2018Data Publishing Framework\\u2019 that would help incentivise efforts and investments by institutions and individuals in facilitating free and open access to biodiversity data. It further postulates the institutionalisation of a \\u2018Data Usage Index (DUI)\\u2019, that would attribute due recognition to multiple players in the data collection/creation, management and publishing cycle. Conclusion: We believe that institutionalisation of such a \\u2018Data Publishing Framework\\u2019 that offers socio-cultural, legal, technical, economic and policy environment conducive for data publishing will facilitate expedited discovery and mobilisation of an exponential increase in quantity of \\u2018fit-for-use\\u2019 primary biodiversity data, much of which is currently invisible.\",\n          \"It is well-known that Sturmian sequences are the non ultimately periodic sequences that are balanced over a 2-letter alphabet. They are also characterized by their complexity: they have exactly $(n+1)$ distinct factors of length $n$. A natural generalization of Sturmian sequences is the set of infinite episturmian sequences. These sequences are not necessarily balanced over a $k$-letter alphabet, nor are they necessarily aperiodic. In this paper, we characterize balanced episturmian sequences, periodic or not, and prove Fraenkel's conjecture for the special case of episturmian sequences. It appears that balanced episturmian sequences are all ultimately periodic and they can be classified in 3 families.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"venue\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Electronic Journal of Combinatorics\",\n          \"Ima Journal of Mathematical Control and Information\",\n          \"IEEE Computer\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In this article, we review the major approaches to machine learning in symbolic domains, covering the tasks of learning concepts from examples, learning search methods, conceptual clustering, and language acquisition. We illustrate each of the basic approaches with paradigmatic examples. (Author)\",\n          \"As is well known in statistics, the resulting linear regressors by using the rank-based Wilcoxon approach to linear regression problems are usually robust against (or insensitive to) outliers. This motivates us to introduce in this paper the Wilcoxon approach to the area of machine learning. Specifically, we investigate four new learning machines, namely Wilcoxon neural network (WNN), Wilcoxon generalized radial basis function network (WGRBFN), Wilcoxon fuzzy neural network (WFNN), and kernel-based Wilcoxon regressor (KWR). These provide alternative learning machines when faced with general nonlinear learning problems. Simple weights updating rules based on gradient descent will be derived. Some numerical examples will be provided to compare the robustness against outliers for various learning machines. Simulation results show that the Wilcoxon learning machines proposed in this paper have good robustness against outliers. We firmly believe that the Wilcoxon approach will provide a promising methodology for many machine learning problems.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
